"✅ Trip Verified | Firstly, they are always late due to their operations issues which makes you miss your transfer. If you are flying with them make sure you have at least 6-7 hours wait at Sabiha Gokce as no matter what they will be late. I flew with them a few times and honestly it’s not worth it. They pretend to be a cheaper airline but again when it comes down to sitting together or adding a luggage it comes out to the same price you will pay for a good airline and trust me it’s not worth it. So much of time wasted and stress. They are pathetic people, lie to you all the time. I flew with them in November and due to some operations problem they were late to take off from Karachi Airport by 2 hours, and I missed my connection because of them in Sabiha Istanbul to London. What they did was gave me another flight for the next day and said they will pay the visa fees and give me a hotel and transfer. They said just write to us and we will refund all the money to you. Pathetic people lied to my face, didn’t gave any compensation at all. Now when I’m writing to them they are like it’s not our fault. Come on shameless rip off airline."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I have always used Pegasus to travel to Turkey and Iran. I am also a member of their BolPoint. I never experience problem with exception of this year 2023. Long delay either ways. In fact my recent return trip from Tehran was awful and very long delay in Tehran, which caused me to lose my connection flight from Istanbul to London, and even my luggage was not put on the flight to London. I must add that the staff of Pegasus, in particular the air crew are wonderful and very helpful."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Due to the war going on at present, and already over a month ago, my flight that was supposed to leave from Tel Aviv on 15 October to Manchester was cancelled.  In the end I had to book an extremely expensive flight (around £400) for a single way, in order to return, as I could not take my Pegasus flight. Pegasus would not refund me for the ticket, despite having cancelled and stated clearly on their website and email that the flight can be refunded but did not keep to their word in any way whatsoever. Additionally, they are barely reachable and a lot of links on their website don't direct anywhere, making it very hard to get through to a live agent for assistance. I highly doubt I will be flying Pegasus again, as this experience proved extremely unreliable."
"✅ Trip Verified | I had the option of EasyJet, SunExpress or Pegasus for this route. All similarly priced. So glad I chose Pegasus. The crew were super friendly, comfortable seats, food was unusually good, included WiFi/entertainment and the flight was on time! Couldn’t ask for more from a budget carrier. Excellent! I flew the return leg with easyJet - the crew were average, seats were tight and the available food was poor."
"✅ Trip Verified | Worst experience ever. I have never written reviews for airlines before, but my experience has been so bad all the way through that now I am doing it. First of all the flight was 3 hours delayed, I had to wait in Istanbul airport (which is one of the worst I've been to in my life). That made me loose my connection in Bruxelles. So I had to buy new tickets from Bruxelles. Since my insurance company needs documentation for the delay I have been calling customer service to get this documentation. I have talked to them 7 times (!) and they have still not been able to give me this basic piece of documentation (which doesn't even cost the airline anything). I have never experienced such bad customer service in my life. The customer service reps also barely speak English."
"✅ Trip Verified |   They have delayed 1 hour, then another 30 minutes and another 30 minutes later. they landed just 15 minutes before my next flight and they did not take any responsibility, no excuses, the representatives are very unprofessional and rude."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The pram of my son arrived damaged after my flight (Ankara to Manchester UK) and is unrepairable as the mechanism is shattered and broken. Made a claim at the airport and also a claim through Pegasus as they requested this with all the footage taken. Came back with an excuse every time and they try everything not to pay me back. It has been nearly 3/4 weeks now and still trying to get away with it while I am not able to go out with my son. Worse customer service I have ever experienced! By law they are fully responsible for any damaged luggage caused by them obviously and they just try to get away with it."
"✅ Trip Verified |  A delay in the return flight (2,5 hours) was absolutely poorly handled, no reason given, at the booth the rude personel were not willing to give any contact information. On contacting them by E-mail to request a certificate for the delay, I got a ridiculous standard E-mail back. "
"Not Verified |  Our flight was delayed 3 times. We got stuck in the airport for hours with no notification. Avoid Pegasus Airlines at all cost. First and last time flying with them."
"Not Verified |  Worst airline, was a horrible experience. It’s the first and definitely the last time!!! I had 2 flights with this airline and both were late. They don't even offer water. The staff only speak Turkish, no smile, not welcoming! I recommend to everyone, please you can pay a bit more to have a better airline."
"✅ Trip Verified |   Pegasus is amongst my favorite low-cost airlines anywhere. Never been disappointed yet. Outstanding cabin crew. Satisfactory food and drink selection. Punctual take-off and landing. Ground crew needs a little improvement. Overall: Great value. Easily recommended."
"✅ Trip Verified | Terrible experience with this airline. Arrived 2.5h before to the check in counter, they took 1:45h to do the check in, they were super unprofessional. Had to run and go through a lot of trouble to be able to catch the flight. Terrible experience. Better to pay more and be safe."
"✅ Trip Verified | We took a flight from London to Dubai and had to change a flight in Istanbul. The flight departed late by 50 minutes. The staff made no effort to welcome any passengers onboard. On the way I asked for a glass of water and was refused, was told pay £2 and buy a bottle. A totally unprofessional staff with no basic knowledge of how to treat their customers. Again the flight that we took from Istanbul was delayed by 25 minutes. On reaching Dubai we found one of our luggage was missing. It was not loaded from Istanbul, and were told it will come after 24 hours. DONT EVEN TRAVEL FOR FREE ON THIS AIRLINE."
"Not Verified |  I am not complaining about the flights although there seems to be more and more delays. I find the Pegasus customer service about as low as you can go, they don't seem to understand basic English and the response time is catastrophic. Their so called special offers for discounts are non existent."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Horrible. This airline can’t operate a flight without delay. This is my third flight with them in the past two weeks and all of them were delayed. Insufficient and rude staff. Amateur service. This is the cheapest airline but avoid it if you can. Your plans will be delayed so you will have to pay extra anyway. Avoid Pegasus Airlines."
"✅ Trip Verified | Worst airline ever. All flights I took with them (4 flights total) were late by at least an hour. No food, no comfort, no service, no nothing. Its like taking a bus. Talking to staff was a nightmare, they barely spoke any language other than turkish."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Departure from Germany to Turkey was about an hour delayed, the second plane from Turkey was 50 minutes delayed. We were asked on the flight from Istanbul to Beirut to pay 40€ extra for each bag we carry, no mattet what it is. The problem with that, is that we came with the same airflight company in the first flight from Germany to Turkey, and we were not demanded to pay, so who can explain the difference in rules since we are talking about the same company, two flights, same day.  I did not get any receipt, what made me question the legetimacy of what they did. One employee wanted to put a label bag tag on my plastic bag that had only biscuits, which was personal property just like a purse, which I also had to pay 40€ for, for a rule I doubt that exist and also when it exists that mistreatment can not be justifible. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Even if its a low budget airline, the crew could say hello when entering the plane, instead of that, the crew member simple stood at the entrance with arms crossed. Seemed we were all unwelcome. Most of the staff unfriendly and no smile at all. Unfortunately i have no other choice then Pegasus to fly to Berlin as fast as possible, but their rudeness alone will make me choose a longer way next time."
"✅ Trip Verified | Worst travel experience in my life. They lost my bag on a local 1 hour flight and their attitude was do not give a damn and actually blamed me for the check in process. Don't ever travel on this airline the customer service has the most frustrated individuals and the board of directors are absolutely negligent professionals. I have sent over 40 emails and calls for my luggage with very little response and still don't have my bag. Its a complete scam and lie. Do yourself a favour avoid this airline at all costs"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Pegasus is a budget airline, its main objective is to transport people at the lowest cost possible. They do so by removing unnecessary services, such as onboard meals and so on. No one expects luxury treatment when flying with Pegasus. The last time I flew with Pegasus my experience was beyond awful. During check-in, I asked an airline representative to check my carry-on bag and put it in the luggage compartment instead of the cabin. Usually airlines don't charge you for this. Sometimes they even ask you to do it when the flight is full. Pegasus told me this wasn't allowed, but I could pay 50USD for extra baggage allowance and in that case they would be able to check my carry-on. I agreed. Upon arrival to my final destination, I discovered that a few items were stolen. The total amount of damage was insignificant. I reported this incident to the airline, but they refused to compensate the damage, saying ""Pegasus's liability is limited"" and ""Pegasus accepts no responsibility for any liability over the applicable liability limits in accordance with legal regulations."""
"Not Verified |  We are flying Amsterdam to Istanbul on 21 June 2023. We had a connecting flight on Pegasus Airlines towards Istanbul at 11.45 am. As we reached the gate the Pegasus staff were horrible, I was shocked how they treated a passenger like that. Very rude, very bad attitude. I’m very shocked I cancelled my one week vacation and came back home. I lost my baggage, still haven't got my baggage. It was my worst trip. I will never recommend this airline to anybody. Please avoid."
"Not Verified |  In short, nothing goes right, timing, notifying about delays on right time, boarding on time i was supposed to fly 4 hours ago and the delay happened twice. And the employee was laughing when i asked her when are we boarding. Worst experience."
"Not Verified | I fly Pegasus for work reasons and do this often, primarily my route is Ankara - Amman (Jordan). This is a night flight PC 1712, which always (!) gets delayed, most often by 1,5 hours. If Pegasus is unable to fly on time why under the Sun they do not change the flight departure time? And if it is always delayed why they would not warn the passengers beforehand? This is absolutely unacceptable. Yes OK Pegasus is a low-coster, but it does not mean they should behave like that."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Never again. Tiny, uncomfortable seats, a completely full flight, forced to gate-check my small carry-on even though the ticket was supposed to have the same luggage allowance as the rest of the itinerary, 10 euros for a dry sandwich on board. Avoid at all costs."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Our flight was canceled just as we arrived at the airport, two hours before the flight. They moved our flight 11 hours later, we had to wait in an airport that doesn't even have flights at that time so the food businesses were closed (Yes!, they were closed from 10am to 5pm) luckily we had some food with us. They moved the other connecting flight from 1pm to 11pm, imagine arriving in a different country at midnight, my hotel reservation was lost and I almost missed a reservation for a $1,000 USD tour. Clearly that's not Pegasus's problem and it doesn't care either."
"Not Verified |  The staff is the most unhelpful, irresponsible and slow. First of all my flight to Istanbul got delayed 3 times. Then on May 1 I wanted to fly back home, arrived 3 hours early and this flight got delayed as well, gates have been changed a few times. In the end I arrived at the gate 15 minutes early and there was no staff anymore so I could not board the plane, same thing happened to 2 other people with different destinations, we were in the line together. I went to 4 Pegasus information/help centers in the airport, every single one was not willing to pay my next flight and blamed me for not arriving even earlier. The announcement when they say last call started a few minutes after I was at the gate but there was still no one. I ended up with the supervisor and they were rude very direct not even willing to hear properly. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  It was a very bad experience. Our flight was very delayed from Muscat to Istanbul and we can't get our next flight. Pegasus staff don't care at all we keep running to each Pegasus staff asking help what to do? Was very bad day we have other programs in Saint Petersburg and we was late 24 hours everything was mixed. In the end Pegasus staff told me to buy visa and to go to other Pegasus office and they promised me the visa payment Pegasus will refund it to me. Was no other choice to stay 24 hours in airport or to pay the visa. Finally we paid the visa to go to other office as Pegasus staff told us but after i paid my visa the Pegasus sent me email they will not refund it to me. What kind of services this how come we need to wait 24hours in the airport. Where is customer care?  They should pay me the money i spend because of them they delay the flight. I will never travel with them from now if they will not refund my right."
"Not Verified |  We checked in for a flight on 29th March to fly from Turkey to Georgia. There were zero issues and their staff didn't notify us that our bags were slightly over the limit. Our flight was cancelled. After 14 hours of waiting, we checked in for a second time (and their staff mentioned nothing about our bags being over the limit).  Once we were through security, we were pulled aside and asked to pay 200 Lira for our bags being slightly over the weight limit. Naturally, I tried to refuse because we were not told about it. Had their staff told us we could have moved some items from our luggage to our hand luggage and avoided the mess. We were told that if we did not pay, we would not be allowed on the flight. It then turned out that the 200 Lira was actually 480 Lira (approx £40 pounds). Two of their employees checked our luggage in with a smile and then had the audacity to inform us that we were slightly over the weight limit. Tto add insult to injury, one of our suit cases is now broken and they are refusing to refund the money. "
"✅ Trip Verified | I used this company flights few times and it was with troubles always. My flights were delayed from 1 till 3 hours, which was unappreciated especially when I was in transit. Their customer service is always unavailable - you cannot call them from any country exclude their native Turkey, but if you are there and trying to call them - they don't answer in 90% cases. They provide no answer by proposed on site WhatsApp, and by e-mail on noticed time (it's over 48 hours each time). But when they answer you it is absolutely inapplicable, because they provide you link to website or info from website only and never answer to your solid question. Usage of their services it just waste of money, time and your mental health. And when you onboard finally you should pay for all - including glass of water. I have extremely worst experience with this company!"
"✅ Trip Verified | Pegasus Airlines lost my bag. I filed a report at my destination airport, but even after multiple mails and calls, they didn't seem to care at all. I applied for a refund, but was offered a ridiculous amount of money. After three months, I finally received one half of the refund, but the other half is still missing. Pegasus does not answer my mails. I will never fly with this airline again, even if they offer the cheapest prices."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I booked my flight back home on Sunday as we have to work on Monday. After checking-in and dropping my bag. I was informed that the flight was cancelled. Which is not the best news to hear of course. There was a long line of passengers that does not move, they wanted us to fly the next day, an offer that normally i won't refuse. However I had several meetings the day after that cannot be simply cancelled. It feels like they are throwing us from one person to another with no respect. I tried to find a reservation to a close airport. However they cancelled all their trips to the north due to weather reasons. There was no refund. My bag still did not arrive after 2 months."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I would like to thank the Pegasus team in Istanbul for the service and hard work they provide in this difficult time after Turkey suffered from the earthquake. The flight was delayed 2 hours and I missed my connecting flight. Considering the whole situation on the country and bad weather conditions, I suppose that delays may happen. Pegasus provided me with another ticket, free hotel stay till my next flight and food. Thank you."
"Not Verified | Pegasus Airlines is your worst nightmare! Never ever take it if you have a choice. It’s not only because of impolite crew members who don’t even greet their customers on board, horrible sits and 2$ tiny water bottles. I took a flight from Sharm-el-Sheikh to St. Petersburg via Istanbul and since the first flight was delayed we missed the next flight and got stuck at the airport for next 10 hours without water, food or any further information regarding our flight. There was a Pegasus counter in transfer zone with 4-6 absolutely useless and incompetent employees doing nonsense. We were around 30ppl from different flights and it took 10 hours of queuing while Pegasus workers were doing nothing just making a mess with documents (losing boarding passes, taking passports and never bringing them back) and shouting at their customers. Finally after 10 hours of desperation they somehow figured out that a lot of passengers don’t even need a visa to enter Turkey and could be delivered to the hotel anytime. Than it took 2 hours for bus to pick us up and additional 20mins standing outside (0C in Istanbul and dozens of people flying back from Egypt in their summer clothes and not expecting winter strolls around snowy Istanbul) The most horrible flying experience in my entire life, choose any other airline if there’s an option never fly with Pegasus if you don’t want to ruin your day/vacation/physical and mental health."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Worst airline. I lost my connection flight from Istanbul to Doha from Manchester. Wasted 1 day and no information for the delay. The next day flight they booked from Istanbul to Doha is delayed again 2 hours. I will not recommend Pegasus airlines for this unacceptable approach. I had to lose my 2 days for the travel and such a tension in the airport when I missed the flight. I had to pay for the evisa for the stay in the country for the next day flight. No information or e emails or nothing from the airline."
"✅ Trip Verified |  It was my first flight after 6 years not flying anywhere. I didn't know the world has changed so hard that they didn't include food and drinks in the ticket price anymore. As you might know, Russian citizens cannot use their bank cards outside Russia due to some restrictions from Europe. So I was carrying some Euro in cash. I bought it in my Moscow bank the day before my trip. How was I supposed to know that all of my money were old Euros and I wouldn't get nor food, neither drink onboard? Seriously, the flight attendant took my 10-euro bill, then another one and returned them to me saying: I am sorry, you get no food and no water for 3.5 hours because your money is old. But what I had really gotten there was a huge amount of frustration and anxiety for 3.5 hours because all I could think about on that plane was are all my money old?  I had no problem with my cash anywhere after that flight. And I am curious if I get something to drink on my way back? What kind of money do you accept on your planes? Why don't you serve free water to your passengers?"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Pegasus lost my luggage, couldn't find it after 3 weeks and offered a ridiculous compensation of 248 Euros for which i had to pay 17E of transfer fee, bringing it down to 231 Euros. Not only do they not compensate for the trouble caused but their luggage refund hardly covers a bag with a few clothes. They may be able to bring people from point A to point B but don't seem to take much responsibility beyond that."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Shocking experience! The worst uncomfortable and crammed seats I have ever seen, secondly there was no water running in the sink in the lavatories which surely is a concern with covid and all. The cabin crew arrived to our flight very late and because of that our flight I’m Doha was delayed and we nearly missed our connection flight. Cabin crew are unfriendly , always have angry closed faces and frown upon being asked anything like if we are disturbing them. I also saw the cabin crew refusing to give a cup of water to a pregnant lady who was flying on that 7 hr flight and had no euros because she was on a connection flight. No inflight entertainment is offered and the crew won’t dim the lights on an overnight flight preventing passengers from sleeping. But after all this for a traumatic first experience what really caused my biggest concern was the fact that several passengers (probably about 10!) started taking their bags and opening luggage compartments (and leaving them open) as soon the plane landed and it was still in taxi. The cabin crew turned a blind eye on this and one of them was actually sleeping on her seat next to us! Meanwhile a bag ended up falling out from the open compartment into a passengers head seating in aisle because this was allowed whilst the aircraft was still running taxi for a further 10 minutes."
"Not Verified | My wife and I had tickets Pegasus from Budapest to Istanbul on January 02, 2023 on flight PC-332. In the morning on the day of departure, we received an SMS about the cancellation of the flight due to bad weather conditions in Istanbul. This reason releases them from liability and indemnification of passengers. However, the weather forecast at Istanbul airport that day showed good weather. That is, the Pegasus airline brazenly deceived us all. Our attempts to change the flight did not lead to anything. The contact phone of the Pegasus did not answer. There was also no representative office of this company at the Budapest airport. All other flights to Istanbul of other companies that day were successfully completed. As a result, we bought more expensive tickets from Turkish Airlines and flew to Istanbul on the same day. Pegasus does not bear any responsibility to its passengers."
"✅ Trip Verified |  This has been the worst experience of my life with this company, i am not even sure to travel again in the next years. A trip that should have taken half a day was transformed into 2 full days of Travel, waiting at the airport during a transfer in Turkey, queuing during hours to get a new flight, no information at all, nobody from the company apologizing for the situation or even giving information. They have no notion of customer service, you are not a human to them, just a problem on their route. I strongly advise you to avoid this company if you do not want to have a very unpleasant experience, as apparently they have very very frequent delays of flights and cancellations of flights due to purely financial reasons and a very bad overall organisation. Then if you miss a transfer you can be sure that the treatment of your demand will be very long and painful. "
"Not Verified | Worst flight I’ve ever been on, abysmal start of a vacation. I don’t think the point of a budget airline is to absolutely humiliate and treat passengers like animals. To start off, our flight was delayed an unacceptable 4 hours at the gate without any explanation and it is still not clear why it got delayed. To top things off, when they let us into the plane, they told us to expect an additional hour of delay in the plane, seated in the most uncomfortable seats, and now one hour has passed with no news as to why all the delaying."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Pros- Low cost Airline. Normally hassle free. Cons - I had booked the flight from Munich to Dammam via Istanbul and had paid for the check in Baggage while booking the ticket online. I was told that the check in bag would be booked till Dammam. But strangely at the Istanbul Airport, I was asked to take the checked in bag as hand bag for which I had to pay extra for the Evisa to get inside Turkey to take the checked in bag. Despite several inquiries with the Airline staff, no real reason or explanation given for this inconvenience."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I took a flight from Casablanca to Moscow with stopover in Istanbul. After reading reviews I was very afraid. I had only 2 hrs to so security control in Istanbul and I was afraid to losing it because of delays. My big luggage was 20,1 kg and I was afraid they will ask me to pay more weight because I bough 20 kg. My hand luggage was heavy and slightly bigger than the company rules. Also my luggage was checked in Casablanca and I was afraid they would loose it or no having enough time to put it in the second place. I was first in the lane when check in started. All was very fast and easy. They didn't charge extra weight, they didn't check hand luggage size or weight (I have seen passengers with many bags and they allowed them to go), both flights were in time, staff and crew kind and helpful.  I will fly again with Pegasus"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Awful staff but great prices and routes. I only fly this airline because they have a direct flight from London to Ankara. One of their staff grabbed me and pulled me post check in to tell me I must check my hand luggage because of a full flight. I told them this is not possible due to having my laptop and valuables. The staff member began swearing at me and telling me he's will tell me what is possible and he will be waiting for me at the gate."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The worst airline I have used. The staff is rude, they doesn't speak (or doesn't want to) English. The cabin was dirty. None of our 4 flights left on time, the maximum delay was 3 hours, which was not compensated. I saw seats that do not recline, extremely uncomfortable. There was no on-board catering, not even water, which no one reported when we were booking our tickets. And the airline broke my new suitcase. "
"Not Verified | Today we were unfortunate to fly with Pegasus Airlines. Our flight was meant to departure from Helsinki at 14:45 which it didn't. And until 19 it wasn't even announced when it'll be. At 19 they said it'll be 0:15 Later they said it'll be 2:30 And now, at midnight they've updated it again - it's now 4:30 in the morning! It's 14 hours of wait! They update it every two hours! they gave a food voucher and a hotel, but you can't sleep - you have to wake up every hour and check if anything has changed! It's outrageous!! The worst flight of my entire life! Absolutely spoiled the beginning of our vacation and 120 EUR wasted on a hotel night we don't get to sleep in on top of ridiculous wait time!"
"Not Verified |  I have previously given a review indicating my luggage was damaged. I couldn't find that review to amend it. The airline did pay for the damage fairly and I thank them for it. Also, I changed my rating for the cabin staff. My previous rating was for the Stockholm-Istanbul flight with the same airline."
"✅ Trip Verified |  This is by far the worst airline I have seen while traveling international they changed my gate last minute and I was running back and fourth trying to find my gate because they changed it last minute during boarding. They don’t care about there customers and only care about the money. I was running in the airport, employees are very rude and unprofessional they don’t even speak English. Pegasus employees did not help me find my gate I had asked them is this the right airline they told me flight was changed so we don’t know with a very little English. By far the worst experience for 400 dollar ticket one way to London. I will never purchase again as I almost missed my flight due to the lack of last minute changes. "
"Not Verified |  The worst airline in the world. 2 weeks ago I was flying with them, my luggage was lost. I had in my luggage the medications necessary for my life because I'm chronically ill. Moreover, in my suitcase I had the things necessary for my work, because of their lack, I incur material losses. They ignore e-mails. I've been calling them for a week, they expose me to the costs of making calls abroad. My suitcase still hasn't arrived, although they promised to send it 72 hours after it went missing and arrive at the hotel within the next 2 days. 16 days have passed and the suitcases are still gone. They ruined my entire vacation!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Just had a lovely flight from Manchester to Dalaman. Crew, service faultless. Only thing it was a night flight and captain had the heating a bit high. But well done Pegasus."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Punctual take-off and landing. Perfect ground service and cabin crew. Seating might have been better but not a major problem for a short haul. Overall, a very pleasant flight for a very good price. Surely recommended."
"✅ Trip Verified |  We were on our honeymoon, my husband and I arrived to the counter where our tickets are issued. we previously booked and paid tickets for both of us months ago. However, when we arrived at the counter, they said that there is no place for us on the plane because we didn't book seats, we only booked tickets. They were overbooked. but this is not our problem! we paid for our tickets! They issued a ticket for me but not for my husband! we explained that we are on honeymoon we cannot go separately - they forced us to transit for 10 hours in Istanbul before going to Cappadocia. So we arrived to Cappadocia at 11PM instead of 10 AM! The staff was very disrespectful and didn't offer any help. We lost time and money. "
"Not Verified |  The dates and times of departure were changed three times on direct and return tickets. As a result, daytime flights were canceled and night flights were left, which initially cost less. Don't buy expensive day tickets, it's a lure, they will cancel them anyway and you will be forced to change tickets for night flights. They will make you do it. Lost baggage containing life-saving medication for a child with epilepsy. The baggage arrived at the airport the next day. They refused to promptly bring baggage from the airport. I had to pay for prompt delivery by taxi. In flight, they did not give free water to either children or the elderly. Bottle of water 200gr. - 2 euros. The senior of team of flight attendants answered - show in the rules where it says about free water.. On the return flight, they checked in a stroller for a 2-year-old child as transit baggage, despite the fact that we warned at check-in that a stroller is needed when transferring. The child was forced to sleep in arms during a 9-hour layover in Antalya. Representatives of the airline do not decide anything. The staff is low qualified. No service. Airplanes are packed. Catching hype on Russian tourists in the current situation."
"✅ Trip Verified |  After reading all these reviews here I have been a little suspicious to book Pegasus to Istanbul. Anyhow all my business contacts are on the Asian side and to get from the new IST airport to the Asian side can take longer than the flight to there. I have been surprised about the performance of Pegasus. Flights are dammed on time. The first low-cost-airline for quite a while which is scheduling their flights that the last round-trip of the day is still on time. I booked me seats in exit rows which are offering a little more space so I was fine. The processes are quite well organized and in SAW my bag was on the belt before I could even arrive there. The bar service is ok. You can buy warm meals and beverages. Price are a little on the high side an the need to improve the payment system. The fact that 3 credit cards issued by German and Irish banks have been rejected which have been used in Turkey and Germany before and after with no problem needs to be changed."
"Not Verified |  Very bad service on board. You feel you are in market not a flight all during the flight selling product. Just to test them i asked for a tap glass of water, they refuse that and ask me to pay £2 for small bottle. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Pegasus has buggy outdated payment system. We had to register and to pay for our pet (small dog). The only way to register is to call them and then to pay via phone. Pegasus rep will ask you for a first 8 digits of your credit card and will transfer you to the automatic dial system to complete the details via phone. And then your nightmare will come true. The phone system will return an random error during typing your credit card. Pegasus reps are aware  of this bug and then advise your to continue typing again and again. However, it doesn't work - after 8  expensive phone calls and 24 tries to type the credit card details it failed. We typed carefully and tried 2 working cards - it was definitely the bug in the system. There was no alternative way of payment! Another Pegasus rep advised me to arrive earlier and tried to pay at the counter (praying no other pets will be at the flight because the limit is 3!). There was no senior supervisor to resolve this issue. A bonus line - people got stuck at the airport with their luggage because they accepted only credit card, no cash option. I helped other travelers paying with my credit card for their extra luggage. Each time we called we got different price for the pet ! 70 or 140 USD. During the final call a rep said it is 70 USD for sure, but in the airport they said 140! But during the payment their system changed it back to 70. Resume: if you flight with no luggage, pets etc it should be OK. Otherwise - stay away from this company."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I bought tickets of Pegasus Airlines in the early March 2022 because Russian airlines stopped flying abroad. In 10 days after that Pegasus announced that flight was cancelled. I chose the refund option and Pegasus sent me an email that my card is unavailable for refund. I replied providing my account details and asking about further steps. But after that Pegasus never replied. I tried to remind them several times, but they still keep silence"
"✅ Trip Verified |  I strongly advise against buying anything from this airline!  Initially, they offered a voucher with an open date or money after covid. In 2021 I applied for tickets, since covid does not end, but they said that they would transfer the money and for 11 months as of now they have been pretending to send money. They lie about technical problems, but they don’t provide proof of translation attempts, that they claim they sent, even though I asked for 8 times!"
"✅ Trip Verified | London to Istanbul. The most horrible and disgusting service I’ve received from anywhere. The staff are extremely unprofessional. He told me to go and contact my agent about the flight when I showed proof that my agent is FLYPGS (Pegasus airlines) then he told me he can’t help me. I ask to be put through to a manager and he also refused and told me he cannot help me. Our flight was cancelled twice by Pegasus, had I known what a disgusting and horrible airline they are I would’ve never booked with them. The plane itself is so tight and cramped you feel claustrophobic for the entire flight. The staff are extremely rude on the phone line as well as on the plane and airport. All they care about is keeping your money. I have now waited a whole week for a refund to only realise I’ve been refunded £30 instead of the whole ticket amount which was over £100. Avoid at all costs! Most disgusting airline and people. If I could give minus 10 stars I would. I will definitely be informing all my family and friends who travel to turkey to avoid this airline at all costs. A disgrace."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I had a bag and a purse with me at the gate, and they told me that I could only have one on the plane. Furthermore, they stated in a very disrespectful and mean manner that I either pay or do not board the flight. I didn't have euros, and after several attempts to explain that a purse is not luggage, they said I had to pay. I only had dollars, so they made me pay $100 USD and refused to exchange (they were charging 70 EUR) claiming they couldn't do it. I'm a frequent traveler, and I've been on all kinds of planes, but I've never seen anything like this before; it's a robbery. Charging a woman $100 for her purse. It is worth noting that I had the same luggage with me on my way to Barcelona and this did not occur."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The departure time was 5am, the flight was on time but the plane decided to wait for latecomers. We waited 2 hour in the departure lounge and then another 30 minutes in the plane. The captain tried to reassure everyone that we would make up the time. I missed my connection. Many people were ushered to hotel which took 1 hour before we got there. the reception at Miracle hotel was passable but the restaurant staff were arrogant to the point where they refused access to the Pegasus travellers. We were made to sit and wait. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Would never recommend it. No service no management just catastrophic from Sabiha Goecken Airport Istanbul. Very long queues no one supporting, very rude staff. No one knows where to go, what to do. Worst service ever. "
"✅ Trip Verified | Check-in is seamless using one of the kiosk. The baggage tag was also printed by the kiosk. Then head to the baggage drop area. The flight itself was okay. Have to pay extra for everything - pretty much like Ryanair in Europe or AirAsia in South East Asia. Inattentive flight attendants, they look unhappy to do their work. It gets you from point A to B. Period. I will still recommend this airline given the price!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Had two nice flights today. Needed to get from Bucharest to Stansted. Was much cheaper to do this trip via Istanbul than any direct flight. I also has 5 hours to see Istanbul. So seemed to be nice aircraft. Modern trim. Comfortable seats. I had 3 seats to myself on both flights. Nice friendly staff with a smile. Nice food at reasonable prices. All on time except we had to hold for 15 minutes at Stansted. Don't normally review anything but thought this airline had some bad reviews so maybe they have improved."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Avoid at all costs! Flight cancelled. No SMS or email sent to inform us. No reason given by counter staff. All customers helplines telephone numbers either do not answer or speak in Turkish only. Staff extremely unhelpful. Missed flight connection to London and incurred additional hotel night in Istanbul. No hotel/food voucher given. They are cheap for a reason!  You have been warned."
"Not Verified | We paid for the seat for better leg space. But the staff name at the check in counter cancelled our seat and we were sent to the supervisor who was equally rude . After which we have to mail the airline for the refund to which also there is no response. This is the most unprofessional airline. If the seat has been cancelled by your staff for what so ever reason isn’t it your duty to refund it back . Why should we write a separate mail and keep waiting for our refund."
"Not Verified | Worst airline ever. I was driven to tears by this airline, disappointed lots of passengers. I also vowed never to use them again. The flight was meant to leave Dubai by 5:15am but they left by 6:48am, on getting to Istanbul I had to get a new boarding ticket to TRNC, they wasted my time for close to an hour and they were well aware my flight already started checking in. On getting to the gate I wasn’t allowed access, was told it was closed. Pegasus never took responsibility for this and made me pay for another ticket to my destination. Not to talk of the bad customer service who use the opportunity of not understanding English to act badly to passengers and ignore us. They also spoilt my luggage."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I can safely say this company is by far the absolute worst when it comes to forward facing staff at the airport. We witnessed people in tears being refused help at Istanbul airport as they were having trouble with their paperwork and the lack of internet in the airport for those trying to use their phones. The staff refused those they choose not to deal with and quickly spoke amongst themselves to be sure their colleagues would not help those selected people as well - passengers were timed out of check in by this horrendous behaviour. I have never ever seen such diabolical behaviour with airport staff. We missed our flight despite being 2 hrs before departure, another man had been there since day before and lost two tickets, countless others having to form a large queue at ticket help desk to re buy tickets - please really look at your options before choosing this disgraceful company - they simply do not deserve customers."
"Not Verified |  I had a flight from Manchester to Erbil via (Sabiha Gökçen airport) SAW. My flight delayed by about 12 hours at Manchester airport - then, my flight delay at my connecting point was 24 hours! My bag was not transited to the next airport, instead, I had to buy Turkish visa and then check in and out to change my bag! Worst airline ever! Change the name from Pegasus to Pega-bus! A bus is a better than this airline indeed!"
"✅ Trip Verified | Had a delay of more than 9 hours. Completely understandable that weather conditions made this happen. But the irony is that for 5 hours in a row they made delay announcement for 1 hour only. So they kept the entire crew next to the gate. And by 4 o'clock in the morning they offered refreshments to us and told us flight wont happen at a minimum until 8am in the morning."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Worst experience with Pegasus Airlines, please do not book the airline. It’s not worth the price paid for it. My flight had been delayed by 7.5 hours from Sebiha Airport in Istanbul to Kayesari Airport. There was absolutely no information conveyed about the same. The staff were not exactly approachable. On my return flight, there was a delay yet again. There are so many better airlines "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Last time using this airline. My first airplane was late 10 hours reached Istanbul, to understand that i have to wait 24 hours to take my other flight. No one cared about us, no hotel, no food, they gave us nothing just headache and waste of time and ruining our vacation. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  We arrived at the airport 1.5 hours before check in with my husband and 2 kids, age 3 and 6. We queued for 20 minutes at a very slow check in where they informed us that out PCR tests should be in printed form and not on our phones. I said that we were not informed about that and that were on a holiday for 2 nights without printers. The lady with her little English was rude telling us that everyone else knew about this except us. She told is to go at a shop 10 meters away were we could print our tests and so we did. We got back 5 minutes after only to tell is that check in is closed and we should buy new tickets for the next flight, while she was walking away with her back on us. And so we bought new tickets for the flight 4 hours later. When checkin was open for the next flight we waited for 20 mins where they informed us that our PCR tests do not have a QR code on them and they will not accept us on the flight. We paid a private clinic to come to the hotel and do the tests and due to lack of information from both the company this happened. We managed to find our QR codes and go print them AGAIN . Communicating in English was very hard , and everyone was rude and did not seem to want to help or be u understanding. This is the worst experience I have had and I will never be back."
"✅ Trip Verified | Take-off and landing was right on-time, which usually is an issue for European low budget airlines. Service is good, prices are cheap for in-flight catering. Seats might surely be more comfortable but you shall accept the fact that you get what you pay for. Pegasus eventually became my go-to airline for short haul domestic Turkish flights with its high price-quality ratio."
"Not Verified |  I highly do not recommend Pegasus Airlines. As I was flying back to Beirut from Istanbul, a women from the airlines stopped me at the gate to check the weight of my carry on (that was already approved at the check-in) and obliged me to pay 100$ for the extra 2kg! She was very mean, impolite, unprofessional and unethical. She was talking to me in an unacceptable way, saying unacceptable words and repeatedly told me that she won't let me get on board without paying or she will throw away my baggage. On the website of the airline there is no mention of 100$ for 2 extra kg, they don't answer nor reply. No wonder Pegasus Airlines seems to be the 'cheapest' airline, they know other ways in stealing the clients money. Surely, no one I know will ever use Pegasus."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Smooth check-in, punctual take-off and landing, smiling crew. Booked the first row, adequate leg space. Middle seat is a bit cramped though, better choose window or aisle seats. No problem at all for a short haul flight. Pretty good overall. Highly satisfactory for a budget airline."
"✅ Trip Verified |  My flight got cancelled from Istanbul to Amman due to the lack of information for the documents that needed to enter to Amman .. you need a negative PCR test, payment for the PCR test at Amman airport and a Medical Insurance. No staff mentioned ""the medical insurance"" until I got to the boarding, the staff told me I cant travel because I didn't have a medical insurance. If they told me while I was checking in, I would have time to make it and I will travel that day. They canceled my flight at the door and I didn't get any money back ."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Avoid flying Pegasus Airlines. Flight was delayed on the departure by 30 minutes due to late arrival, after take off pilot announced there are some technical troubles and we need to return to Prague, saying it will take around 30 minutes to fix. It was 1 hour and 45 minutes before we were in the air again. Service on board very terrible. ""Due to Covid"", as the flight attendant said, they do not provide any onboard food apart of basic snacks. Seat comfortable. Flight was diverted due to not clear reasons to another airport where no one was able to say what is going on. Crew disappeared and no information was shared. I was able to get what is going on only because my seat was in second row. No communication what so ever through speaker, after some time passengers who transfer could get out. It took almost 4 hours before they let anyone out and plane departed to original destination. Only 0.2 liter bottle of water was provided to us, terrible service from the crew and weak communication. I understand the reasons behind diverting flight to different airport were not caused by airline but the initial delay and lack of any communication after landing was the worse. For your own safety and piece of mind, do not ever fly Pegasus."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Ground staff comprehension skills are so low. I had an approval from my destination country that mentions “exempted from quarantine”, the ground staff were insisting for me to have hotel quarantine and held me for more than 30mins! They tried calling for other colleagues and was unsure of what they are doing. I ended up going back on the line without even a proper explanation. Worst ground staff service ever."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Preflight and during were fine, average what you expect from a budget airline. Upon arriving in Istanbul, I found out my luggage wasn't there. Because another flight came in in 2 days, I had to wait three days for delivery of my luggage. Customer service and communication were okay. Contact couldn't be done through email though. Pegasus Airlines' desk at the airport told me it was the mistake of the luggage handling company at the airport I was flying from. However, the luggage handling company told me it was the other way around. To save time I didn't take it to 'court'."
"✅ Trip Verified | Such a disastrous airline with the poorest communication management system. I was supposed to fly from Doha to Tiblisi via Istanbul this morning but they did not allow me to check in as I didn’t carry a PCR test which was earlier informed as not required as I am fully vaccinated. There was no communication from the airlines about the latest requirement set by them and they surprised me at the counter and behaved so rudely towards me. Their website wasn’t updated and moreover their customer service rep confirmed that PCR is not required if your final destination is Georgia as I’m vaccinated. They made a huge chaos in my life and were not even ready to accept their fault. When I raised it as a concern they blamed me for not calling them or checking with them about the requirements whereas their website has outdated information and their so called customer service representative also provided false information. Who will compensate me for the time and money I spent during the whole chaos? Such a useless airlines and customer support."
"✅ Trip Verified | Using the services of Pegasus Airlines - you do it at your own risk. I was able to make sure of this a few days ago, when from Istanbul, where I was in transit, I was not permitted to board on the flight to Manchester. According to UK regulations, the arriving in the country must fill out a form and pay for a COVID home test kit, for self-control after arrival. However, for some categories there is a formal exception to the rule. When boarding the flight, I presented all the necessary documents confirming that an exception to the general rule applies to me. However, the airline employees refused to let me on the flight due to the lack of the mentioned COVID home test kit. When the situation cleared up, my plane had already departed. I was not offered any compensation or a replacement ticket, the manager behaved rudely. I do not recommend using the services of this airline."
"Not Verified |  Worst airline!! not recommended at all!! not responsible! worst experience. My luggage didn't arrive with me, it went to Dusseldorf instead of Barcelona. I had to wait 5 days to have my luggage. I had to take the optima ticket and to pay extra baggage in order to carry all these stuff and at the end everything went into the garbage because of their irresponsibility. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  They told me I cannot enter the plane with my pet even though I confirmed with their airline prior to the flight and with a vet which papers I would need. It even says on their website that I did not need a pet passport, that only flights to the EU require this. They admitted it was wrong, but they didn't do anything about it. No refund or anything. I had to speak to 10 employees and all of them were unprofessional and rude. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Got to check in when it was still open. Tickets were bought with Turkish Residency card and were not matching with the HED code. For 20 mins staff were rejecting any try to fix the issue as we had a valid HES codes for each passenger. Because the system didn't recognise it they didn't allow us to go on board and I was left with two kids in airport. Immediately checked with management they said your tickets are burned and there is no refund, when the plane still didn't take off. Later the staff advised actually you supposed to link your HES code in a different way, after the flight is gone. This is unacceptable. Rude staff have us so much of stress and caused us money loss."
"Not Verified |  Was on my way back from Istanbul to Berlin, only to get denied boarding at the last minute with a group of some other passengers. The reason: you need to present a PCR test to fly to Germany with Pegasus specifically. The test was not required by German officials (we all called and even double checked with the health ministry). We were not even informed about this by the airline when we bought the ticket. We of course got several commercial emails to buy additional services but nothing about a required test. The staff were terribly unprofessional and unhelpful. Some even rude. We were there confused for hours trying to figure out what should we do. They took our passports(!) and disappeared for at least 1 hour leaving us confused in the international area of the airport. First saying we could book another flight, and then after wasting 4 hours of our time arguing with several incompetent employees who barely spoke English, turned out we had to re-enter the country, buy new tickets, do an unnecessary corona test, book a hotel for a night and return to Germany the next day. Terrible experience."
"✅ Trip Verified | Flight from Istanbul to Amsterdam. Flight number: WZ72JB - PC1253. I was after surgery, I tried to pay for water with my Netherlands card. Of course it is a problem if you don't have a visa. I needed to drink my pills after surgery but I couldn't pay so I didn't get any water. I thought  I get could get one cup for free (I saw the cabin crew drinking from big bottles) but no. I felt very bad during the flight but nobody came to me. On landing people started to pick up their stuff, the young cabin crew started screaming that they must sit. It was not professional! Terrible service! I flight all the time and have never met people like on this flight. Also baggage! Before my flight I bought extra baggage - 20 kg - 15e but I didn't get any confirmation to my email or to my electronic ticket. Of course I had paid but there was a problem between the bank and Pegasus so I paid double because I had to buy my 20kg again at the airport."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Worst airline ever, I paid for extra baggage and on the way back the check in service told me that they will charge me extra because they wont count the sum weight of my two baggage which is by the way less than the extra that i paid for. I even called their customer service before my flight and asked them if they will calculate both baggage together and they said YES on the check in they wanted me to pay extra and said a new rule was made one day before my flight date. I was never informed of the rule by email or message or any way. So not reliable at all, even in their own rules. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Bought 2 tickets on Pegasus airlines to Istanbul with the special offer: Free changes! This meant that I could change my travels dates without paying the change fee, which was a great deal due to the current global pandemic. However, when I wanted to change my flight the mobile app and web app were both down. I called customer service and was told the system was being restarted and I could only make changes over the phone or wait. Since my flight was that day, and I needed to change it ASAP since Turkey had just announced they would be introducing restrictions and new measures that day. Obviously, I wasn't about to travel and needed to change my ticket. So I asked the customer service representative whether I could change my ticket free of charge over the phone since I had no other option (of no fault of my own). She said she would have to charge me the change fee and I could then ask for a refund which I would get since it wasn't my fault. After sending in 2 complaints and multiple emails, Pegasus airlines still refuses to refund the fee. Not to mention all the money I spent on the customer service call even though THEIR SYSTEM WAS DOWN. "
"Not Verified |  Flight from Antalya was late due to technical error and I asked to get off plane first because of timing for next flight (we were sitting in last rows) - something every decent company does and has understanding for when flight is delayed by the company. We had 30 minutes to get to next flight because of this delay. There was no understanding or help from flight attendants at all. In fact all I got was rude comments from them. Worst client service ever. I will never use this airline again. They act as if passengers are there for them and not the other way round. Planes are packed and no distance is provided, no disinfection on board, they are not taking any measures regarding Covid."
"Not Verified | Had a bad experience with customer service, the guy didn’t understand me and I ended up giving up and being charged for seats when I shouldn’t have been charged. Flight from Stansted to Antalya was terrible. No social distancing and flight attendants were not doing anything to help. We had a family all gathering around our chair and I had to complain before anything was done about it. Flight attendants were miserable and the flight was packed. No social distancing during Covid and so many people were not wearing masks and the attendants were not telling people to put them on. However flight on way back was good. Flight attendants were good, encouraged social distancing, told people to wear their masks and were always cleaning."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I bought a ticket from Krasnodar to Istanbul, arrived at the airport, and the flight was not canceled, it simply does not exist! the airline did not warn that the flight would not be. Tickets continue to be bought. I also bought tickets from Istanbul to Dalaman, which I also cannot use because I didn't fly out of Krasnodar. Wrote a complaint to the airline, at the moment no one has contacted me. Spent about $600 on a trip that I could not complete."
"Not Verified | We booked a ticket to London from Istanbul for a holiday in July in late February. But because of the COVID -19 pandemic all our plans we’re ruined. We called them and they recommended us to turn our ticket into a open ticket as we would not be able to get a full refund. So we went with their word and turned it into an open ticket and every time we tried to reissue one ticket (we had to pay the difference) after the payment the system got crashed. We attempted 3 times to reissue and each time our payment went through without any confirmation.They took almost 3 months to give us those refunds. Very bad customer service and we lost hope and had to cancel our flight and lost £115 at the end. One of the worst and unhelpful customer service."
"✅ Trip Verified |  On the 17th March I purchased a ticket to fly to Istanbul, Turkey from their website. There was no indication Turkey would close its border on the website, google etc due to COVID as it’s a very fluid situation. On the 18th when I arrived at the desk to check-in my bags I was informed that Turkey had now closed its borders due to COVID. I spoke to the manager and he told me I was due a full refund and to call the customer service hotline to instigate this. This was a major inconvenience as I was hoping for an instant refund and I ended up paying 1700 to fly to Dublin a few hours later. I was assured by their customer service a full refund would be issued and then heard nothing for a few weeks. They tried to claim I didn’t show up for the flight/I cancelled it myself and didn’t want to fly etc which wasn’t the case. Online there is dozens of complaints from other dissatisfied customers who haven’t been issued refunds and it seems this is the route the company is taking. They issued me with a refund of 23.56 euro which also doesn’t make sense?  They didn't provide the service which I was entitled to and have absolutely no reason to be holding onto my money. I presented myself at the airport."
"Not Verified |  Due to coronavirus flight got cancelled. Understandable. Flight tickets would be reimbursed. Understandable. Two months further still nothing refunded, chased them for weeks now: they responded; when the travel ban is lifted 2 months after you will receive the refund. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  There is no online check-in website in English. Mobile application won't download. Once completed they do not issue or send you the boarding pass automatically but you need to do several other further steps to have it forwarded to your e-mail or phone all in Turkish. That's incomprehensible. Flight crew was courteous on the flight to Bishkek and the flight was nice."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Sharjah to Beirut via Istanbul booked for later in March 2020. Worst airline website ever. Trying to contact Pegasus Airlines the whole day with more than one hour waiting time and no response. Waste of money and time Not recommended at all"
"Not Verified |  Doha to Berlin via Istanbul. I have flown with Pegasus airlines 3 times and out of the 3 times my Bag has been damaged twice and I have a strong bag, the bag was damaged in the corner which keep in mind is the strongest part of the bag. I have tried following up with them on this case however they have taken forever to reply and have not taken any care or shown me support they are nice to you however as the call is being recorded so they will be nice but show no effort in support towards me. I have been told that I was on the top of the list (they always say that to keep you pleased) however it has nearly been a week since they have replied with me being on ""the top of the list"" I am very unsatisfied with the treatment. I have also been sent or rather passed around in the airport as no one helped me, I was very tired from my flight so I headed home and continued via email which was my mistake. My father worked hard for the money he has earned and It has gona to waste as the bag has lost wheels and been cut open which resulted in some damage on the inside as well. I do not hope to see anyone get the same treatment as I did and wish you all the best. Thank you"
"Not Verified |  Due to bad weather the plane could not land in Krasnodar airport, so the plane rerouted to Trabzon. The problem was that we stayed inside the Trabzon airport for 16 hours with minimum food and water. The situation was unacceptable, Pegasus Airlines did not allow us to leave the airport neither gave us any information about the issue."
"✅ Trip Verified |  They cancelled the flight on us during return back to Istanbul due to Sabiha airport problems leaving our flight with another airline to catch at extreme jeopardy. I realize that airport issues are beyond their control. However, what I was very disappointed at is that their rep was not forthcoming with information, he played with words giving us false hope that the flight was just delayed (even displayed as such on the airport departure board) while in fact the flight was cancelled. His job was just to give passengers false hope. Only when I persisted on him that I had another flight to catch when he said, buy with another airline. The next flight was half a day away, Pegasus did not offer any accommodation or food to any passenger. My kids and I had to sleep on the airport chairs for the night until the next day afternoon. Was horrible experience. I came to learn days after that Pegasus was supposed to provide us with accommodation and meals .. too late. Let me recommend this, make this airline you absolute last resort .. and it is not family friendly. There were only two families with kids in the flight we used. They won't even give the kids a sip of water unless you pay ridiculous price. The seats do not recline and do not have charging ports. On the bright side, they were flexible with weight (on our outbound flight) and they refunded me the unused portion of the flight."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Very incompetent staff. My flight was from Antalya to Amsterdam connecting to Reykjavik with Icelandair. The check oin officer was supposed to check my bags from Antalya to Amsterdam as my arrival time to Istanbul was 9 am and my flight to Amsterdam was at 1030. By the time I collected my bags the counter was closed. I tried to get help but was asked to talk to many incompetent people including the manager and sales office with no benefit. I had to buy new tickets through Turkish airlines. Avoid Pegasus airlines at all costs."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Istanbul to Stansted. I wouldn't fly with Pegasus Airlines ever again.   £200 less than BA but I was made to book another flight because we were 4 mins late before the gate closed. We had our daughter with us who is 17 months. We had already done online checkin! All we had to do was drop our bags off. The lady at the desk said we were late.  I asked to speak to the Manager. No one came and at this point I knew i had to pay for another flight so I said just get me on another flight as we were only away for 4 days. i had to pay £379.20 on the spot. Didn't accept Credit card. Customer service was shocking!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Istanbul to Kuwait. I had arrived the airport 2 hours and half before the flight and though we could not make it to the plane.  I was surprised when first arrived pegasus counters to discover the all flights are served together, no matter when and where the flights go. No employee to arrange the crowd, everybody was just waiting his turn. Finally we got our boarding pass and to find out 45 minutes left to fly . Even the direction signs were not clear to differentiate domestic from international passport control. Few minutes later I found myself standing in another long row. I had finished that stage and got the departure stamp on our passports to catch up the gate after 5 minutes behind schedule, but the plane and the shuttle bus were still avail. I could not get in. then I went to Pegasus office and they let me and my family go into Turkey again to stay for any upcoming flight and stay in any hotel on my charge. Worst travel experience for a family ever. Never try this low cost company. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Dubai to Istanbul. Worse company ever! At check in, extra luggages I booked and paid for weren't updated in system so we had to wait 30 min with big queue behind us. Despite I have bill and invoices. We board in and stayed 2 hours on the ground without explanation, staff emptied the plane and we don't know what to expect. We lost our connection, train and hotel booking because of them. Staff very rude and shouting at customers, unable to handle the situation. Service customers denied to reply to me. Never again!"
"✅ Trip Verified | Istanbul to Ras Al Khaimah. Never chose this company! Pay more, but don't believe in Pegasus! They cancel my flight, didn't send any email to advise and gave no refund or compensation. Totally shameful. Beside all that the treatment in the airport was completely disrespectful."
"Not Verified |  Me and my friend have to say that our trip from Antalya to Stockholm 21 of October 2019 was perfect! I traveled also with my dog in the cabin. The staff was excellent. A special thank you I have to give to Bugra, you made our trip so much fun and unforgettable. We looking forward to fly again with Pegasus."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Istanbul to Ankara. Very capable, smiling, helpful, diligent cabin crew. Seat pitch was very good, although seating was not very comfy. I was alone on a three-seat row. Although take-off was a bit delayed, the flight landed on-time. Pre-bought sandwich was pretty good, prices for drinks are reasonable, thumbs up for alcohol on a domestic short-haul and all these on a low-cost experience. Quite unexpected and pleasant surprise for anyone who has seen European low-cost flights."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Gazipasa to Istanbul. Let me began with this, if you are looking for cheap flight which is less than one and half hours, Pegasus is good option. However, you should take this for you consideration that, your seat is not going to be recline and you would probably left the aircraft thirsty after you flight.  On the other hand, briefing in their flight is masterpiece. Pilot briefed passengers 15 minutes before landing which is weird for me. All in all, it was good experience to flew with them, but I prefer not to fly with them anymore."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Istanbul to Athens. We had 2 different PNRS and they took all of the luggages under 1 PNR (which obviously means the 2nd one didnt have any registered luggage) and charged us 105€ extra without explaining the situation. They never fixed their mistake but just threatened to cancel the flight unless we paid. The funny thing is how it was shown in the system what happened and Pegasus Athens was supposedly taking care of it while their call center - to which we were emailing in Turkish - literally mailed that we exceeded the luggage allowance and that they never give wrong information. And that their supervisor said there were no extra people there that is why they added all the luggage under 1 PNR. Which was a lie because the people from the 2nd PNR were called to give their luggage and my mother was asking for their own group's luggage stickers which they never got because they had to wait for them to make the mistake of adding all of them in one PNR . So my mom received 8 stickers for luggage and paid 105€. Their way of handling these situations by literally calling you crazy and saying how the supervisors report matters more - and that you should use your legal rights- it's just frustrating. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  
I was very disappointed with the flight and staff who overcharged me for luggage. I paid for extra luggage through the app but I was told the 40 kg that I paid extra for was free and included within my ticket price and my son had no allowance dispite paying full adult rates. In had the police called on me at the airport when I tried to stand my ground but fortunately the policeman was very good and took my side. The staff wasted over 2 and a half hour of our time and the only way we could get on the plane was to pay extra. After writing to Pegasus they now say they have investigated but have all the facts wrong and have refused to refund the extra charges. They have unfortunately ruined our holiday at the last and left us so disheartened that we will definitely not be travelling with them again."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Tel Aviv to Stansted via Istanbul. The flight from TLV-SAW-STN was good. As one would expect from low cost company. The service on the airplane was except from the fact you will not receive a cap of water for free and bring water on board in not allowed. We got our pre-ordered food and it was very good. On our way back to TLV, in SAW, in the gate after the boarding tickets scanned and right before we stepped in the sleeve to the airplane, we were stopped. Our bags were re-weighted and we were asked to pay $160 for over weight. We refused to pay saying all our bags were weigted in London. The team on the gate was very aggressive. They took our bags by force demanded our passports and boarding tickets and told us they will call the police (which they didn't). We still insisted not to pay they told us we are too dangerous to go on the airplane and that they cancel the flight for us. We told them we have a check - in bag on the airplane, they told us it will be removed (and he was not removed). After we went to seek for help in Pegasus offices in the airport, in the tickets office and in the check in desks supervisor, a lady appeared from the crew in the gate and talked with officer in front of us. After that they told us sorry we can't help you. They claimed we used violence that we didn't and that we are too dangerous. I was traveling with my family, 2 adults and 3 kids ages 11, 9 and 5. Eventually we purchased new tickets and arrived TLV 14 hours later then we should have. We spent the night in the airport with our kids. I will never fly again with Pegasus Airlines. It looks like the team in the gate was not part of the regular gate team but an ad-hoc team that after finished with us went on to other gate doing the same thing. Stopping passengers in the gate after scanning their boarding tickets, on their way to the airplane and weighting their bags with biased scale in order to take more money from them."
"Not Verified | I've been travelling with my wife from Dubai to Istanbul and back, so I was surprised about the price which was for 2-way ticket and checked the reviews regarding this airline, but I can assure that the price, service and inside aircraft are worth the price they are offering 100%. I was fully satisfied by choosing this airline and the trip as well. Thank you!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Dubai to Tirana. It was the first time and the last time that I travel with this airline. All of my souvenir from Dubai in my baggage was broken.  You could ask for a blanket as the AC was in the max of cold. Everything was chargeable with ridiculous prices. My luggage got broken during the traveling. The plain smelt horrible and the toilets were very dirty."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Istanbul to Rome. The staff at the Istanbul boarding gate  grabbed my carry-on luggage and started weighing. I was surprised and I am presented with a bill of 240 of some currency, for carrying overweight carryon and laptop bag. I asked to know what weight my carry-on was but no answer. Another man came more rude than the others. He seized my bag and asked to either pay or I would not be allowed to fly. Granted my bag was weighed with water and food that I just bought at the airport, my phone and mp3 player, my wallet and my camera were all in the bags. I did buy some souvenir at the airport and could have removed them but he refused to reweigh my bags saying I had to pay or forfeit my bag. I eventually gave them my Amex card for the $72 bill. Lo and behold “we don’t take Amex” is what I was told, well that’s a problem as that’s all I had. No cash. They insisted on cash or no box while also threatening to prevent me from flying when my wife was already boarded. I was eventually allowed on the flight with only my computer bag while my carry-on luggage was confiscated. I arrived at Rome with no box or any information as to how to collect my box. I had to file a lost baggage claim. This is an airline I will recommend that people avoid at all cost."
"Not Verified |  Dammam to Copenhagen via Istanbul. This is so boring. When we wanted to check in our baggage they did not allow us 1 more kg as we had 1 kg as overweight bagage and they told us to pay for it. Furthermore, our hand carry was allowed in Dammam Airport but Sabiha Airport they charged us because we had bought some stuff from duty-free in both Dammam and Sabiha Airport and our hand-carry got a bit overweight. This happened at the boarding time when a staff member just came from nowhere and asked to check our hand-carry and that time ”final call” notification also started ticking and we just paid that charge."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Dubai to Istambul. Never in my life I faced so rude staff from any place except when I was preparing the check in for my returning flight to Dubai. The lady at the check in was out of information, as a resident with a valid ID I can enter to UAE with out showing my resident stamp in my passport but she started calling Duty managers and everyone until they decided that I can not travel, so she said I need tourist visa, so ridiculous, being a UAE resident, I need a visa to enter. So I demand to talk with the manager cause all those smart agent were not aware of my privileges as resident. After arguing with that smart lady she got angry cause I put my phone over the desk, then, that ""worker"" transformed, she start shouting on me why I was taking a picture. She retaining my passport against my will.  After 15 minutes the DM came and she decided I can travel."
"✅ Trip Verified |  İstanbul to Sharja. The worst airline ever. Workers were rude, seat are not comfortable, the AC was low people were sweating. You had only 20 kilograms over that you pay $12 for each kilogram."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Istanbul to Dubai. Worst airline in the world.  Extremely rude. Paid for 25 kg of luggage nut they said it’s not in their system. Paid for better seats got regular seats. Charged $180 extra for nothing. Run, don’t walk, away from this airline"
"Not Verified |  Istanbul to Beirut. Crew was really friendly but the plane got delayed for 2 hours without any explanation. Turbulence was really bad."
"Not Verified |  Beirut to Istanbul. We left at 6 in the morning. We stayed around 2 hours flight to Istanbul, they didn't offer us any free drink or snack. All drinks and snacks are priced in euros. While they can at least offer us a free cup of coffee or tea."
"✅ Trip Verified | Trabzon to Izmir with Pegasus Airlines. I was in a rush and used online check-in to be sure. But I had to give my bag to baggage check. I was late but ground staff helped me. I thought I had already missed the boarding time but again, ground staff helped me. Flight was on time. Price burned down my wallet. No giveaways."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Amsterdam to Doha via Istanbul. I traveled at seat 14D-F with my family. It was behind the exit seats. Seats were really narrow, it was a terrible flight. Additionally, the cabin temperature was high."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The worst ever. From Budapest to Beirut via Istanbul we’re allowed 20 kgs only and 8kg hand bag. I didn’t want to carry many bags so I had a bag of 25 kg. They made me pay 108 euros for those extra kilos even though I am allowed for 8 more kilos"
"✅ Trip Verified | Izmir to Trabzon with Pegasus Airlines. Flight was fast and good. Most importantly, it was on time. There is no treat from the airline but food and beverage menu is rich. Prices are high. In Turkey, Pegasus is well known with flight delays but I've only experienced one at a ten. Cabin crew is good."
"✅ Trip Verified | First time flying with Pegasus Airlines. Very impressed. I flew SHJ-SAW-STN (same outbound and return route). Airplane was modern (but with no TV on back of screen). Cabin crew were very friendly, attentive, well presented and approachable. They all spoke English. Safety briefing was conducted in dual Turkish/English. Airplane ran on time, no delays. Ground staff were efficient. I booked an exit row seat for the SAW-STN leg which provided ample room to stretch out. Even the normal seat had enough leg room for a large grown man like me. Pre-ordered food online (which gave more choice as to what to eat on board). Breakfast tray was tasty, fresh and well presented. On-board drinks/snacks were available and whilst expensive, were good quality and fresh. Pegasus' baggage policy means a lot of passengers opt not to check in bags (at cost) and take an 8kg cabin bag on board. Some passengers were being greedy by trying to stuff small suitcases into the cabin hold - the cabin crew did not complain but it caused some delays inside the plane trying to get everyone's bags packed away and seated on time."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Sharjah to Amsterdam via Ankara/İstanbul. We passed the registration and handed over our luggage, Pegasus employees took our hand luggage from us near the ramp. Sports bag weighing about 10kg. And a suitcase of 8-10 kg.  Flight RS0747 was delayed and we were extra urgently in Ankara. Our plane was three hours at Ankara airport. For reasons unknown to us. I see this for the first time. People began to leave in Ankara. About 10 people left the plane. Accordingly, their luggage was somehow given to them. The rest flew to Istanbul. When leaving I wondered where my bag was (hand luggage) I was told all the luggage would be transferred to the next flight. A Pegasus representative met us all and explained to whom and where to go. Some of the people stayed in the hotel. We went to the Pegasus counter for the next flight to Amsterdam. There we more than once clarified “Where are our bags ??”, we were told: “You will get all the luggage in Amsterdam!” I traveled not alone but with my boyfriend. We passed the luggage together. In Amsterdam, nothing of our luggage has come! All 4 pieces of baggage Pegasus lost. We have issued the lost baggage at the counter. We were told to wait 3-5 days. The next day we took 2 large suitcases. A day later, one bag of hand luggage. And to this day there is no one more last bag. In this bag were personal items: shoes, outerwear, handbags, perfume. Mood was spoiled. In Amsterdam was forced to wear what it flew into. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Stansted to Athens via Istanbul. Decided to give this airline a go because they had a fare for under £100 as a last-minute booking, with a 2 hour connection, compared to other airlines wanting double that. You can get the mobile boarding pass but there are issues with their app if you always dont have access to the internet. The boarding pass did not save down without you having to put in the booking reference each time and searching for it again which needs an internet connection. When i got to Istanbul i had no internet for my boarding pass but fortunately there was transfer desk who printed out a manual boarding card without a ounce of grief. I would recommend emailing your boarding passes until they sort this issue. Its very tight seating and the flight was full and the service was basic but i couldn't care less on a flight less than 4 hours. We got there and that's the main thing. Really overpriced food cart so make sure you stock up on your basic snacks. I thought that Istanbul Gokcen was a great airport to transit in great food court facilities and a cheeky way to stock up on cheap tobacco in transit back to Europe. The only thing i didn't care for was Stansted - worst airport that surrounds the London area. Hopefully they expand to Gatwick someday we need airline like this to keep the fares low."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Amsterdam to Beirut via Istanbul. Terrible customer service experience. I had a flight with a transfer. My bag was a few kilos overweight so I paid the additional 75 euros before my first flight. At this point I was given a receipt and a bag sticker and was told to present this at the next airport if necessary. While boarding the second flight from Istanbul, I was stopped where they informed me that my cabin bag was overweight. I showed the staff members the receipt and bag sticker and yet insisted I pay an additional 45 euros (reduced from 90) and in her very limited English implied that I should hurry up because the flight was leaving and that I would not be allowed to board without paying. I have flown several budget airlines without trouble, but this one was by far the most incompetent."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Istanbul to Stansted. Worst customer service ever. Flight delayed by 1.5 hrs and no proper explanation given why, aircraft not cleaned from previous flight, crew don't speak english, not greeted when entering aircraft, took nearly 2 hours to be served for a drinks and snacks and at the end didn't have what asked for as ran out of menu items on a row 19. Very incompetent staff. Will never ever fly with them again. Absolutely not recommended"
"Not Verified |  Muscat to Vienna via Istanbul. This is the worst airline I have used! The flight was delayed and I missed my connection but nobody cared about it! The delay was only 10 minutes and they didn’t wait however they can see in the system the I am checked in and their plane is late. At the airport office I was waiting 1 hour so that anybody talks to me and Change my flight. They poorly speak English so it took me a while to explain what happened and finally get help. "
"Not Verified |  Dubai to Istanbul. Awful seats. Not comfortable at all for a 5 hours trip from Dubai to Istanbul. No entertainment and even the chairs are not going back so you can sleep like on any other airlines due to the very small spaces between the chairs. Horrible trip. Not recommended at all."
"Not Verified |  Tel Aviv to Budapest via Istanbul. Excellent staff and service. Our flight got delayed due technical issues and we had to stay overnight in Istanbul. I just would like to express my gratitude to the handling staff, air and ground. Everything ran smoothly and very efficiant. We knew what was going on during the whole time, the staff was taking care of all quickly and with a smile. Technical issues are part of life but what was excellent is the way the company handles these situations. We got compensated for the delay on time and without issues. Thank you Pegasus. Definitely my choice for next flight!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  On October 6th I flew from Beirut to Marseille via Istanbul on Pegasus Airlines. On my transit stop I was able to visit a business lounge in Istanbul airport(SAW). Was able to relax and wait for my next flight in comfort. Overall a great flight. I will always fly Pegasus given a chance."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew Pegasus from Beirut to Istanbul last week - rude flight attendants. It was a dirty aircraft with dirty bathrooms. People kept on trying to open the air vents above their heads, but no air come through. Everything on this airplane was for money. No screen, maps or No food. Moreover, on our day back to Beirut, they have changed the flight time an hour and didnt inform us about that - we missed our flight because of them and they have cancelled our ticket to Beirut and made us pay another one way ticket. However, we were not that stupid to use that plane again, we booked on Middle East Airlines. I  would pay a few more dollars to avoid the worst airline conditions I've experienced."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Gatwick to Dalaman. I booked a flight months before as was travelling independently to Turkey. Pegasus was the best price for the flight times. Unfortunately as the Pegasus site seemed to run slow and never complete the booking, I booked via Olympic Holidays. The disadvantage of this was that you could not pre book seats/meals with either as Pegasus could not clearly use an Olympic reference and Olympic could not book any extras. At Gatwick airport check in was far too slow and it took 1 hour and 20 minutes. I asked politely for a window seat and was allocated. The flight was not announced until 19:40 for a scheduled departure at 20:10. Clearly we were not going to leave on time. The flight was fine but there seemed to be very few cabin staff so it took a long time for each sequence of drinks and food to occur. It is difficult for the staff & passengers as all the prices were in Euros despite being a Turkish Airline but they do have a lot of routed in the Euro Zone. The crew ran out of change for sterling and this again occurred on the return flight. Passengers assisted and I gather from one crew member this is not uncommon. What happens if they simply cannot obtain change? This took up a considerable amount of time. Pegasus support your crew with sufficient float! On the return journey, check in seemed late opening, I requested a window seat, the man dismissed the request saying seats already allocated. It was a rather bumpy landing at Gatwick but all was well. I decided to book for the same journey for September 2019 as the Facebook page was offering Summer 2019 flights. However none are available, other airlines have started booking"
"Not Verified |  I recently flew with Pegasus to North Cyprus via Turkey. Taking advantage of their pre flight menu I ordered Mushroom Risotto and my wife ordered Chicken Schnitzel. It would appear that something was lost in translation. My Risotto manifested itself into Ravioli and my wife's choice was like the sacrificial lamb. Never again. On the return journey we hoped to choose from the on board flight menu, but sitting in row 20 we where served last and consequently by the time they got to us most of the available food had been sold or not even loaded. We were later offered the duty free drinks menu and decided to purchase two bottles of gin. Again none available. If this airline wants to compete in international air travel then they need to buck up and get their act together. Next time I travel to North Cyprus it will be by the Short Route through South Cyprus and not endure the 10 hours flight via Turkey."
"✅ Trip Verified | SAW-SXF: Boarding was a huge mess. They first announced people of zone ""A"" would first board. I was zone B, so I waited but they actually never called zone B, so I was one of the last pax to board which meant there was almost no overhead space left. Plane was packed. Aircraft was a 2-year-old A320neo (TC-NBE). The seat was alright, it didn't recline and they weren't really comfortable but that's what you get when you fly low-cost. No IFE, no overhead screens to see flight stats. Took off and landed on time. SXF-SAW: Boarding was a little better as they didn't mention any zones. Had seat 3C, 3A and 3B were empty. Aircraft was a 6-year-old B738 (TC-CPE), though the seats were the same as the newer A320neo, so they didn't recline either. Plane was dirty as the crew only had like 5 minutes to clean the aircraft. I flew with Pegasus B738 plenty of times before and they had overhead screens for flight stats, but Pegasus either had them removed or they don't use them anymore. Took off on time, landed early but landing was very rough. On both flights the crew seemed very tired and like they didn't really care about their job. They weren't really good in English. Also one thing I noticed on both flights was how they just put a plastic soap bottle bought off a dollar store in the lavatories."
"✅ Trip Verified | Istanbul to London. It was a terrible experience. I was waiting in the queue to check in, the queue was very long and I had to wait more than an hour, when I finally reached the desk, the member of staff told me that I can't do a check in because it's less than 60 min left to my flight (it was 58 min) and he advised me to speak with supervisor. I went to speak with supervisor who was dealing with other unhappy customers (many of them). At first she didn't even pay attention when I came to talk to her, after waiting around 15 min she told me that she can't do anything about it and told me to go to Pegasus ticket desk, when I went there the member of staff told me that they can't do anything about that as well, as I had to arrive earlier to the airport (not sure how early that should be). She said that there is another flight to London however the plane is full and she advised me to check with other airlines. Thank you Pegasus for such a ""great service"". I had to buy 2 more flight tickets which were not cheap. I'm very, very disappointed, I wanted to save money, but finally I just spent way more. I asked for a refund but all I've been told was that I wasn't present at check in desk 60 min before flight so there is nothing what they can do. I will never fly with Pegasus again and I will advise others of the same."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Brussels to Beirut via Istanbul. I will avoid if possible. 40 min delay and broken seat, customers that use this are also terrible, caused extra delays. I bought last minute (expensive) tickets so value for money not good"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Dubai to Stansted via Istanbul. Budget airline, cramped and uncomfortable, no in flight entertainment (ok with one of those neck pillows you can buy) but less than half the price of the likes of Emirates / Etihad. However they should accept all types of credit card (my UAE one wouldn’t work but luckily I had cash for water!) They get you on and off the plane speedily. Not sure why people are complaining, you get what you pay for. Very friendly staff too working with what they are given to provide a great service on a not so great plane."
"✅ Trip Verified | London to Izmir. You usually know what to expect with a low company but this one beats them all. Took back and forth and exactly the same issues - flight is late and no information communicated. Most disgusting planes ever with all tables covered with filth probably never washed, seat pockets are the same with food pieces and drink smears everywhere. Most seats are broken and I flew almost with my front neighbours seat in my face. Toilets smell - a bonus. Basic safety rules disregarded on both flights - hostesses are not checking if passengers have seat belt a on etc - people were jumping out of their chairs as soon as we were on cruising speed on land which is strictly forbidden - we did not even have an English presentation of the safety rules - only Turkish. The food is close to vile and prices are ridiculous - 14 euros! Captain did not say anything during our flight. Most seats were broken and arm rests taped! 1st flight our plane still smelt of cigarette - looked like a plane from the 80s. Funny thing tickets were not that cheap either! Just thankful I got where I needed in one piece but will never use them again even at the price of not flying direct."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Amman to Antalya. It was a terrible experience, they broke my check in bag, it’s expensive and good quality bag. And, their employees don’t aware about company rules, I resrved a business flex, so, I have 20 kg check in and 12 kg carry on, but the employee at the check in counter asked me to remove a 3 kg from 11 kg carry on bag! Honestly they are terrible."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Stansted to Dubai via Istanbul. Pegasus airline was by far the worst airline I have ever encountered. Although the ticket wasn’t as expensive as fancy airlines, it was not worth the price. I personally regret not investing more money on a quality airline rather than a random airline. The seat  was so small that you were constantly touching the person next to you with your leg. The staff was unbelievably rude and not helpful. I asked the air hostess if I was gonna miss my flight as I had a layover, the man was unhelpful and said he doesn’t know anything until I went and spoke to another staff. Both flights I was in were delayed hours and were extremely slow. Overall I genuinely don’t recommend this airline, even if it is cheaper than others."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Frankfurt to Sharm El Sheikh return via Istanbul. The ground crew and crew was friendly and professional. The check-in was always quite tedious. Here I can only recommend to be very early at the counter. Aircraft types: A320-200neo; A320-200; A320-200; 737-800. The airbuses were clean and relatively young. The Boeing was a bit older and a bit worn. The seat backs could only be adjusted in the Boeing. The seating comfort was okay overall. For more than 3 hours I would not want to do without a backrest adjustment. We had weighed and measured our luggage before (on-board luggage) so there were no problems. Boarding passes we got in Frankfurt for both flights. You can also do an online checkin beforehand. For a seat reservation no fee is required. On the return trip, we only got a boarding pass for the first flight in Sharm El Sheikh. In Istanbul, we then had to get the 2nd for the connecting flight at the transit counter. Early to go to the counter, otherwise queue! On-board service is available for a fee, which is normal for low-cost airlines. The quality is good. The seat pitch is at Lufthansa short-haul level. It is slightly lower in the Boeing than in the Airbus. Entertainment does not exist. A delay was only on our 1st flight ... approx. 30 minutes. All other flights were on time. Gate changes have also been made 1 time. But was announced in time and the new gate was right next door. Sabiha Gokcen Airport is much better than its reputation in my opinion. There are a lot of restaurants and various shops, as well as plenty of seating. The paths are short, as the airport is not too big. Cleanliness is ok. Staff is professional and sufficiently friendly. Toilets are bearable.  Our luggage arrived intact and complete in Sharm El Sheikh or Frankfurt. As an experienced Ryanair customer I have to give Pegasus a better rating than them. Ryanair is extremely annoying with its additional charges, its fussy luggage rules and its permanent advertising on board. Ryanair also only flies the Boeing 737 and is definitely less comfortable than the A320. In addition, lately the negative headlines about strike etc. All in all, we were quite satisfied with Pegasus."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Istanbul to Zurich. I have approx 10 flight with Pegasus Airlines for 4 years, one of them was delayed which is normal. I cannot understand the people who buy plane ticket for low cost and expect most of things should be free of charge."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Istanbul to Budapest. This is the absolute worst airline i have ever flown. I was standing in the ticket check in line (the line where they check your ticket to let you through the gate) for one and a half hours. The flight ended up delayed by 2 hours which made me miss my other flight from Budapest to Marrakech. And when i asked them for a refund they tell me that it's not their responsibility as my second flight was with another airline."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Istanbul to Athens. If you can afford to pay a bit more never travel on this awful airline. I was in the check in queue 2.5 hours before my flight to Athens with my husband and 3 kids and because of the useless check in staff was still about 30 people away from the counter an hour and a half after i arrived at the airport. The staff are most unpleasant and unhelpful and after asking 2 of them if they can assist us in checking in quicker we were still told to follow the queue knowing full well that we were never going to make the flight in time. Eventually i got permission from the supervisor and went to the check in counter of the one i initally asked help from. She was so upset that we had asked the supervisor that she deliberately made us pay for 5kg extra and told us that we cannot remove the 5kg from the bag. My husband was so angry that he just payed the 200TL charge so that we could run with our 3 kids to make the flight - such awful service from people who are suppose to help you in making it on time for your flight - never again Pegasus staff need training in customer service."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Bishkek to Vienna via Istanbul. My worst flight ever by far, delayed, slow and somewhat chaotic. No free food / drinks on a 6hrs long flight. If you wanna pay prepare for chaotic staff commonly not having change etc. (major world currencies used). The staff are not very helpful and attentive. Used this company due to lack of competition on the line I have used. Avoid this company guys."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Flew Pegasus Airlines from Doha to Stansted via Sabihah Gokcen. Not too bad for a budget airline! Both flights were fairly well on time, and the staff on board weren't as rude as on Turkish Airlines. Food and drink onboard wasn't cheap, of course, and neither do the seats recline (standard budget airline), but both mine and my wife's bags transferred straight through with no problems, and the lay-over wasn't too long."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Doha to Amsterdam via Istanbul. Pegasus has the worst customer service of any airline.  Constant delays, horribly uncomfortable conditions, and ridiculously expensive add-ons for any conceivable (and otherwise standard) service. If you fly this airline, beware: anything above 70 euros for an international flight with Pegasus is too much. Pay a bit more and enjoy a superior experience with any other company."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Bodrum to Tehran via Istanbul. Me and my friend had the worst possible experience with Pegasus and Istanbul Sabiha Gokcen Airport (SAW) staff; on June 29th 2018 we were going from Bodrum to Tehran and had a few hours stop in Istanbul. As we were waiting at the gate some Pegasus staff showed up and shouted there would be one hour delay, we knew Pegasus didn’t offer meal during the flight so we decided to go to the next snack bar and eat something before boarding. We returned to the gate half an hour later and surprisingly found they had already closed the gate and didn’t allow us to get on the plane although the boarding bridge was still in place and we could see staff getting in and out of the plane which took off 20 minutes later.  During our exhausting 8 hour stay at Sabiha Gokcen Airport we just struggled to find and communicate to someone who could help or give us some information. Most of the staff, including Pegasus and Pegasus Manager couldn’t or didn’t want to speak English properly, we didn’t speak Turkish so it was really hard to communicate - Most of the staff, including Pegasus supervisor and Pegasus Manager weren’t helpful, all they had to say repeatedly was we should pay and buy new tickets for their next day flight - We had to wait from 12:00am to 3:00am before getting the chance to speak to a Pegasus supervisor, an sleepy arrogant young woman who didn’t have the slightest idea what customer appreciation means - The plane had took our luggage to Tehran, so they literally left us, two transit passengers, without our personal belongings in the middle of the night in a city we didn’t have a place to stay. Luckily, I could find a Turkish Airline flight from Istanbul Atatürk Airport (IST) to Tehran the next morning and decided to never again fly with Pegasus or any other cheap no-name airlines. It really worth to pay slightly more for your ticket and get it from a solid well-known airline which understands the value of their customers and don’t trap you with their tricks and hidden costs."
"Not Verified |  The worst airline I have travelled. Flight delayed for half an hr - no explanation given. On boarding the flight it transpired that seat numbers mean nothing, with everyone sitting wherever they please. I was informed by another passenger that apparently there was an issue so now seat numbers don’t mean anything. Rude cabin crew. Not interested in helping or doing their job. All overhead space full, informed by cabin crew we should go all the way to front of cabin to find overhead space, surely this is what they’re being paid to do? I would never fly with Pegasus Airlines again, not even worth paying a single penny in my opinion. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Ercan to Riyadh via Istanbul. Pegasus was always known for being a cheap airline so not much was expected, but what I got was much worse than what I expected. First of all I wanted to change my reservation, so I did through the website, but my one of my connection flights were canceled automatically. I called the international CS number and they told me to make another booking for only the canceled flight and that my trip will stay the same. Then I emailed CS and was told that my reservation was now void after I made the new booking. So I called the Cyprus CS number to which a very disgruntled employee answered calling me ""bro"" and telling me to ask my embassy even though my issue had nothing with the embassy. When I tried to explain to him what had happened he hung up and when I tried again there was no answer. I filed a complaint through email to which I got no response at all they just ignored. Cue the day of the flight, I arrived 1.5 hours before take off, and the check in was so slow that I ended up running towards the plane because I was late. We boarded and the staff discovered that the check in employees had put stickers on 3 bags labeling them as carry on when they didn't fit and had to be promptly taken to baggage.  One passenger was ejected from the plane before take off, so the cabin crew conducted a search to identify the owners of every bag in the overhead bins for security, except they missed 7 or 8 bags in a row 2 of which were mine."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Madrid to Athens via Istanbul. Awful experience. Missed the connecting flight to Athens after spending 12 hours in transit. No announcement was made despite all the other flights being announced. My name was not announced. No help from the staff who spoke incomprehensible English, and no alternatives to try to get to my destination. At the end I had to pay for another ticket to Madrid. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  I returned from holiday on a Pegasus flight from Istanbul to Stansted on 14 April 2018. My baggage did not arrive. I have spent the last 3.5 weeks trying to get in touch with Pegasus to resolve the issue. It has been a nightmare and I still have no idea where my suitcase is or whether I am ever going to see it again. Pegasus have ignored the various enquiries I have logged (via their website) and the UK call centre say they can't help me as I have to wait for a response to the online contact form. It is bad enough that Pegasus lost my luggage in the first place but it is even worse that they have not even acknowledged my loss (and that it is impossible to get in touch with them). They are not regulated by the Civil Aviation Authority so there is no regulator UK passengers can escalate matters to."
"✅ Trip Verified | I was very nervous to fly with Pegasus because of the reviews regarding hand luggage. I ended up having a pretty good trip with them and will be flying with them again soon. The flight was on time and the crew were very nice. It is cramped but no worse than any other budget airline. I was carrying a backpack, purse, umbrella and two jackets with no issues. Barcelona: My checked luggage was overweight by 1 kilo and they let it pass. My carry on was at 10 kilo and they said don't worry about it, we don't weigh it, we just check that it fits in their sizer thing. Istanbul: I was worried again that they would weigh my carry on and they did not, they just checked the size again. Many people looked light they were carrying way more than 8kilo or even 12Kilo."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Bahrain to Copenhagen via Istanbul. Cabin crew  rude, seats are extremely uncomfortable they do not recline, space is very tight, passengers were very noisy. They don't provide meals except for extra fees payable when booking, the snacks for sale during flight were very expensive, no screen or any kind of entertainment. The allowed luggage weight less than other airlines."
"✅ Trip Verified | Was due to take return leg of this flight from Ankara to Amman at 2pm. Flight was delayed. Then at 4.30 the plane was towed away. Then at 5pm there was a general hubbub around the gate desk. Apparently the flight was cancelled. Nobody from ground services spoke English. I had planned to make a connecting flight in Amman. Got no assistance from anyone. Had to rebook flights to my final destination to attend important meetings. This cost me about €1000. Pegasus disclaim all responsibility. Although the Amman routing is convenient for me I will never use this airline again for any purpose. Cabin crew were not especially friendly and the plane on the first leg was dirty. The toilet especially was filthy. Ashamed that this airline had some Irish investment. Pegasus Airlines is by a long way the worst airline experience I have ever had. I typically fly 100 hours plus all year and often with budget airlines. This one is in a class of its own though. Awful experience."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Tehran to Stansted via Istanbul. This airline is ok but seat are small not reclining Which  make you very tired. Food is not free. The people who working inside plane are nice. Not any entertainment, not even tv even in to show where is the flight gone so far. I will not recommend to anyone."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Berlin to İstanbul. Horrible airline =with zero importance to customer happiness. Super narrow seating, very small space underneath the seat to fit your bag, no place to hang your coat or the option to change the angle of the seating back. The hostesses don’t even stop to listen to you unless you are paying for something. The check-in staff said our laptop backpacks were too big and we can’t enter the flight unless we pay extra 20 euros to check in our cabin bags as luggage. We had to wait at the check-in queue although we were already checked in as there was no other queue. Then the staff confirmed we could pay with a credit card, 30 minutes left for the flight and sent our luggage off. Then she sent us all the way to the other side of the terminal to pay with the card and come back to the check-in gate. She should have informed us of this before casually sending us off less then half an hour to the flight. The tickets are cheap with Pegasus Airlines, but traveling is hell. Budget airlines do charge you for extra stuff, but Pegasus is ripping you off."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Samara to Istambul. The departure was cancelled an hour before departure though even the front desk has been defined. Any compensation. Only a refund for the ticket or exchange for flight which had to take place allegedly in 2 days. Awful company, budgetary, planes same. I think that it is better to overpay 10-20% and to fly other companies, it will be more reliable and more pleasant."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Tel Aviv to Istanbul. The flight was delayed on departure for no apparent reason, no update online. When I went to board the plane, they wouldn't let me board the plane with my bag since it was too heavy. Made me pay 50 euros to take it as luggage, even though the cost was 15 euro online when i checked in. I said if I don't get my luggage back i'll take them to court. The staff said that I'm threatening her and threatening to call security. I told her to call whoever she wants, she told me to get on the plane."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Antalya to Ankara with Pegasus Airlines which was a nightmare. Just before boarding time the flight got delayed with one hour. Then when one hour had passed, it got delayed another 3 hours. There was no explanation on why it got delayed and I had another flight from Ankara airport to Dubai airport which I probably wouldn't be able to make since the flight kept being delayed. I tried to talk with the staff from Pegasus airlines and tried explain them that I had a connected flight in Ankara airport and there was a big possibility I wouldn't make that flight since I would have less than 30 min. to board to the other airplane when landing now that it had been delayed. Since the staff didn't care and weren't helpful at all, I tried to call the Pegasus airlines customer service that had poor english and promised me someone from Pegasus airlines would help me with making my other flight when I land in Ankara airport. After 5 hours delay we finally boarded. When I landed in Ankara airport, nobody came to help me at the airport even though I got told so.. with less than 30 min I didn't make it to my connected flight. I tried call customer service of Pegasus Airlines and explained them that because of the delay I didn't make my connected flight. Basically they said it wasn't their problem since its normal that there is delay and they are not responsible for I didn't make the other flight even though the flight was 5 hours delayed. They couldn't understand why they should be responsible for I didn't make my connected flight which was shocking for me since they promised me they would help me making it and that there would be enough time to board to the connected flight when I land etc.  I will never fly with Pegasus again and I will never recommend it. Their customer service was awfully rude and they lied and didn't want to take any responsibility. In the end I had to pay myself for a new ticket and wait days in Ankara to finally be able to fly to Dubai and I will not be able to reach home to celebrate Christmas with my family..."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Stansted to Istanbul. The flight was busy, and there was not enough spaces in the overhead lockers for me to put the cabin baggage (although the staff at the gate let me through with it), so one of the stewards took the suitcase and told me I could pick it up at the airport. However, he never gave her the baggage tag for it - only made a note of the seat and attached the details to the handle of the suitcase. Upon arrival at Sabiha Gokcen in Istanbul, I couldn't find the suitcase. The lost and found at the airport didn't open the case / report since there was no baggage tag available, so I spent nearly the whole week between airport and Pegasus in the search of my bag. Only after threatening with police investigation, Pegasus agreed to look for it and found it and sent the bag back to London a week later! I am still chasing them for their response to my request for compensation for delayed baggage!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Istanbul Sabiha Gokçen to London supposed to depart at 9.30am. The pilot announced 10 minutes delay due to disembarking of the luggages of no show passengers. However the wait exceeded an hour with no further announcement. They did not offer free water and crew stayed in the crew area. I understand that Pegasus is a low cost carrier and they sell everything in flight. But in this situation the crew did not even offer to sell water let alone offering free drinks. If you have a choice do not fly with this airline to anywhere taking more than an hour. As there is no inflight entertainment except reading the Pegasus magazine."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Dubai to Istanbul return with Pegasus Airlines Worst flight ever, seats are too small not comfortable. Aircraft are old. No screens. Flight duration is 4 hrs 30 minutes. And they broke my luggage in Istanbul to Dubai flight. I will never fly with them again."
"✅ Verified Review |  Beirut to Amsterdam via Istambul. I bought a ticket for December 2017 with the option to change the return by paying an extra amount as I was not sure about the return date. I decided to change the date today. I called the office and they told me the extra charge would be 32 dollars whereas it showed a surcharge of 100 dollars on the internet. By the time I reached their office I was told the surcharge would be 149 dollars. I decided to go back to the internet. When I checked the extra charge on the internet it had climbed to 212 dollars. I checked the regular price of the ticket and it was 224 dollars which means that the difference between buying a new ticket and changing the old one was only 12 dollars So I decided to buy a new ticket and get the old one reimbursed. When I did so, I discovered that they would only reimburse me 42 dollars. So what I learned is first they have incompetent staff, second the company is making them pay an extra amount for flexibility when in fact there is nothing flexible in their tickets. All I can say is: avoid this company if you can."
"✅ Verified Review |  Dubai to Athens via Istanbul. The worst experience of my life. We waited more than 4hrs in the flight and the crew attendant simply told us she does not know what is happening and cannot help us. All passengers were angry and some had to cancel their flights and some put in a hotel saying that the next flight will be tomorrow morning and we will be informed of our new booking but still no answer - just keep waiting. On top of that no one answer your call when you call the agency. Cheap airline and cheap service - never again will travel with Pegasus."
"✅ Verified Review |  Faultless service by Pegasus across all sectors from Athens to Bodrum via Istanbul. Brand new planes, first time on the A320NEO. An extremely quiet aircraft. No delays. Boarding was done efficiently. Planes very clean. Helpful staff both on board and on the ground. Very good value for money. Will look forward to flying them again!"
"✅ Verified Review |  Stansted to Abu Dhabi via Istanbul. If you are looking for a dirt cheap flight without any comfort then this might be the airline for you. That is the plus side. Tried to checkin 72 hours in advance and the site was down. When I eventually tried to check in they told me that check in was prohibited for me. Called their call centre and he told me that online checkin was not available for British citizens. He stated it was a UK government directive. The agent at the airport stated that was not correct.  So no online checkin not available for British citizens apparently. When I said I would like to select an isle seat he said we do not allow passengers to select seats on checkin and you would get a middle seat. So passengers who checkin early get the worst seats. Arrived at the airport 3 hours early and spent 90 minutes in the queue, back staring to hurt. Representative at the airport said she had never heard of such a government directive reading checkin of British passport holders. So their agent was not truthful to cover up a poor service. Check in was fine, delightful lady. Plane late departure due to excessive checkin times/queues, late aircraft arrival, Euro traffic control or congestion in Turkish airspace. All were give. However departure staff at the gate were very pleasant. Boeing 737-800 out of STN. Where did they buy those seats?  Well disguised wooden bench. Very uncomfortable. Pointless paying for extra legroom as I did. Boeing 737-800 out of SAW, no seat recline, no pocket to put things in and no cushion effect. No inflight entertainment either. The in light map was looking out if the window. Finally you pay for everything. Food, tea, coffee, water and seat selection. "
"✅ Verified Review |  Antalya to Kuwait via Istanbul. Bad experience with Pegasus. Missed our transfer flight because the airline staff would not assist to let us pass through passport control quickly, and even though I told them that we will miss our plane if we waited in line, they insisted that there is time to catch the transfer plane، Eventually there was no time and we had to wait 9 hours for next flight. No compensation whatsoever was provided like hotel or lounge. Airline insisted that its not their fault."
"✅ Verified Review |  Athens to Ankara via Istanbul. The reason I purchased a ticket this time with them is because it was suppose to be a direct flight. Months later they email me informing me that it would not be a direct flight so I was stuck with this ticket. My flight was suppose to only take 1.5 hours from Athens to Ankara. As of this point I am still waiting and it's already been 10 hours and I'm stuck in Istanbul airport. "
"✅ Verified Review |  Contrary to some other postings here, I'm happy with what I got with Pegasus Airlines. Modern airplane (737 Next Gen, TC-AIS) from Baghdad to Berlin via Istanbul, on time departures, friendly cabin staff, clean cabin, decent seats with sufficient legroom (Turkish Airlines are worse in economy) - all at reasonable prices (half of what Turkish has offered). No hassles, smooth alternative getting from A to B. Bring your own device, as they don't have entertainment onboard. Will for sure fly again, great value for money.
"
"✅ Verified Review |  Flew Pegasus from Düsseldorf to Istanbul. The flight was just a nightmare! The cabin crew were unfriendly, not smiling at all. They are very inattentive, started the service in our row and while we were still ordering they talked with colleagues or served beverages to other passengers and were not paying attention, forgetting to give out our snacks although we paid for it. The flight started in Germany and there was not even one flight attendant speaking German. The cabin was very old, dirty and small, even in the emergency exit row the space was smaller than in other A320 I travelled before. I cannot recommend this airline at all."
"✅ Verified Review |  This will be the first and last time I fly Pegasus. Flew from Barcelona to Dubai via Istanbul. After my carry-ons were approved in Barcelona, Pegasus staff in Istanbul were carrying mobile weighing devices during boarding to confirms carry-ons were a total of 8kgs. My carry on was 8kgs and my laptop bag was 6kgs without my laptop, they told me I had to pay 16 euros for each 1kg over 8kgs. I ended up having to pay 130 something euros on the spot with the staff being incredibly impatient with me, telling me multiple times I had to throw away my luggage if I didn't want to pay and that they could not wait for me to make a decision as it was the final call. Her tone and manner were appalling. On the flight, everything including the water has to be paid for. Definitely not a budget airline as they try to squeeze every penny out of you for basic amenities that any other airlines allows."
"✅ Verified Review |  Brussels Charleroi to Istanbul. I have travelled up to 10 times with this airline in the last two years and this lastest experience has pushed me more to take the time to write this negative review. Cabin crew are unwelcoming individuals. The majority of employees don't seem to enjoy what they do or the way they are being treated by the management. The amount of rude employees is appaling. I don't believe I have ever written such a negative comment about a service and frankly I regret having to do so.

"✅ Verified Review |  Beirut to Paris via Istanbul. My first and last time with Pegasus Airlines. Let me begin with their helpful office in Beirut. I asked if the ticket is refundable if the visa was rejected. She said no and if I want later on to use the ticket for another flight it will cost me double the price. My friend asked how much we pay if we wanted to get another bag, the lady said around 40usd for an additional 20kgs bag. I don't know what got into me but we booked. On the airplane it was not comfortable, thank God the flight was not too long. we could track the flight on one screen out of 4 flights - in the other airplanes the screen were not working. The flight attendants don't speak English -  we don't ask you to be fluent but a basic English is required.  And the head crew who knows English was talking too fast we couldn't understand a thing! Of course they don't offer anything not even water. They don't turn off the light during the flight. They did only for few minutes. On the way back they made my friend pay 155 euros for an additional 11kgs carry on when in Beirut in their office they told us that an extra 20kgs costs 40usd! And for those of you who think it is a cheap flight, it is not that cheap for the services they offer. Meanwhile a direct flight from Beirut in a respectful airline was only 80USD more expensive but we had already booked with Pegasus and the ticket is not refundable. And the flight back to Beirut was delayed for one hour. They didn't even bother mentioning that before and we were gonna miss our flight from Istanbul to Beirut. Bad airline, bad crew, bad service. Not recommended."
"Istanbul to Doha with Pegasus Airlines. The price was really good and purchasing the ticket online was a breeze. I could hardly understand the announcements made in English as the crew was speaking too fast. This was a 4-hour flight (scheduled to depart at 2240 hrs and arrive at 0230 hrs) however, the cabin lights were only slightly dimmed throughout the flight and it was difficult to get some sleep. Air conditioning was very weak for most of the flight and seats are not comfortable."
"✅ Verified Review |  Istanbul Sabiha Gokcen to London Gatwick. I was very reluctant to buy a return ticket to Istanbul from Pegasus Airlines, after reading some of the previous reviews. But as it most suited the day and times I wanted to travel, I decided to try them. I have been flying for over 40 years and could not find any fault with Pegasus Airlines. The communication, easy booking, timekeeping and the staff were all excellent on my both journeys. For an economy Airline, I can only say well done."
"✅ Verified Review |  I had a connected flight ticket from Amsterdam to Zaporizhya via Istanbul SAW. The flight from Amsterdam to Istanbul was fine, but then my flight to Zaporizhya was cancelled. Airline representative in Istanbul SAW airport was not so friendly and didn't want to speak English, when only few of passengers could understand Turkish and helped to understand to others what's going on. Representatives said the reason why flight is cancelled was the weather issue in Zaporizhya, however contacting my relatives in Zaporizhya I've heard that the weather was fine. The procedure of taking all of us out to the hotel from the airport took more then 4 hours, with lots off stress. For the main question ""When will we have the flight to Zaporizhya?"" no one of representatives did not give a clean answer. Someone said - ""you can change your ticket and fly to Kharkov and then go back to Zaporizhya by yourself, without any provided transport from the airlines"", someone said - ""don't worry your flight will be arranged next day at 13:00"". Also many passengers received the text message with apologies from Pegasus Airlines about cancelled flight due weather issues and that there will be a flight next day at 13:00. The next day when all passengers checked out of the HolidayInn hotel the receptionist gave the information that there won't be a flight to Zaporizhya and we have to check in again and stay in the hotel another night. So far the passengers and me included still in Istanbul waiting for another changes. I'm very disappointed with Pegasus Airlines service and would not recommend it, unless you don't mind to waste couple of your days for your trip."
"✅ Verified Review | This is a budget airline, but with that in mind, I didn't have any problems with Pegasus Airlines. I paid USD $65 from London Gatwick to Istanbul-S.Gokcen direct flight. Flight left and arrived on time, the crew were lovely and accommodating to my needs and they spoke English. Refreshments were available on the flight for purchase but I always plan ahead and had my own food on me. There was no in flight entertainment available but then again it's not that long of a flight and to be honest it is a budget airline and as such what was available was what I expected. I would fly with them again."
"✅ Verified Review |  Antalya to Frankfurt via Istanbul SAW with Pegasus Airlines. The seat was quite annoying but it can be accepted because of the cheap flight ticket price. The food, which was a sandwich, was a bit bad. But we arrieved early."
"Stansted to Ercan via Istanbul with Pegasus Airlines. First crew not very helpful and hardly spoke English at all. The Pegasus Cafe booklet shows if you buy 2 bottles of JP Chenet it will cost you 10 euros for the 2. We wanetd 2 bottles of white. There was no white wine left by the time the crew got to us and we were only in row 7. So we asked for 1 rose and 1 red but according to the very arrogant young man we could not have them both at the cheaper price. He said you can have 2 white and he could not understand that he had no white left that's why we asked for the other 2. I know it should not bother me but it is a matter of principle as on the way back we asked if we had 2 different ones would we get the cheaper price and was told yes of course. The rudeness of the crew did not help the situation. In fact the flight left Stansted 1.5 hours late. Somebody stayed on the plane at Istanbul instead of getting off which caused another further delay as the headcount had to be done 4 times and by then the pilot had missed his take-off time and we eventually arrived at our hotel at 12.30 in the morning from a 1.30pm take off flight. Never again would we go with Pegasus."
"✅ Verified Review | London Stansted to Gazipasa via Istanbul with Pegasus Airlines. Appalled by the lack of updates and poor customer service. Flight was supposed to be at 1.20pm, having checked in at 11am left plenty of time. Finally told at 1.30pm we were delayed until 1.45pm, however we didn't board until 2.10pm making us over an hour late taking off with a flight connection in Istanbul a worry. When we we finally arrived at Istanbul late, there was no information as to exactly where to go and passport control was backed up. Despite asking various airport officials for help as we were late, no one wanted to know or could offer help. We were still queues in in passport control at 8.15pm. We finally got through and asked where to get our next boarding pass and to say Pegasus were unhelpful is an understatement. We were told basically tough we had missed the flight and sent round and round in circles. My husband eventually managed to find a helpful supervisor at the Pegasus desk, around 11.00pm who initially told us our luggage was in Gazipasa and that they may be able to get us on flight to Antalya but getting our luggage was down to us. Something we explained wasn't as this whole nightmare scenario was down to Pegasus. We had lost money paying for a transfer on the night from Gazipasa and would have to pay again after the next flight too. Anyway we were then told that we could be put on next morning flight to Gazipasa. Finally we were transferred to a little hotel and got there for about 2 hours sleep, finally reaching our destination Sunday morning. This has caused so much distress and ruined our experience of Pegasus travel, as they have no back up service and don't care. We also weren't the only ones put in this situation by Pegasus. Avoid them at all costs."
"✅ Verified Review | I fly between Ankara and Istanbul regularly every week due to my job. I fly with Pegasus Airlines 80% of the time due to their low fares. I am usually satisfied with their service, since I do not have high expectations, because I pay next to nothing to fly on their planes. My fight tonight from Istanbul to Ankara was an exception though, in the sense that I was overwhelmed with the quality of the service I received. The plane itself was a new A320Neo (you could literally smell the new car smell); and on top of that the cabin crew were the best that I have experience. They were all smiles at all times, but professional when it came to enforcing flight rules. I cannot conceive better travel conditions at these rock-bottom rates"
"✅ Verified Review |  Dubai to Dusseldorf via Istanbul Sabiha. I have never been so disappointed with any company.  The flight was supposed to leave at 04:20 but was being delayed several times. Every time the provision of information was below par, one employee of the airport/Pegasus came to explain what was going on to a couple of passengers who would then (or not) spread the information to the other passengers. This went on until about 9 in the morning when the news spread that the flight had been cancelled and that our luggage would be returned to us. Again, we only heard this information from other passengers. All we were left with was a phone number which was of course not available. As we had to go back home on that date we saw no other way than to book an expensive replacement flight. As the service number did not work we sent an email to Pegasus customer service to which we never had a reply. The next day, when we were already back home, I received an email wishing us a good flight on the 5th August from Dubai to Dusseldorf. No-one had ever communicated with us that we were booked on a flight from Dubai to Dusseldorf, this was the first time we found out. This is exemplary for how Pegasus communicates with its customers, or how it fails to communicate. The next step was to get back the ticket prices we paid, we were entitled to a compensation and on the phone Pegasus agreed to transfer this money back to us within a week. After two weeks, no money had been transferred, I contacted the customer service by mail asking for the money. First they said that I agreed not to ask for any compensation (why would I do that?), after a couple of mails back and forth they finally agreed to transfer the money and asked for my bank details. This has now been over a month and despite several calls and emails no-one has ever properly replied to me."
"London Gatwick to Dalaman with Pegasus Airlines. Awful service received onboard - staff are so rude and unhelpful and walk away or point blank ignore you when you ask. There is more room on a washing line peg than there is on this airline - they clearly pack as many people as possible. No inflight entertainment on a 4.5 hour flight. I will never use this airline again."
"Manchester to Dalaman and we had no problems. They didn't even weigh our hand luggage. Only had delay of 40 mins as they missed the slot. Cabin crew ok but limited English which didn't bother us. Flight back was also good left on time back to Manchester but had to wait 20 mins to get of flight - not Pegasus fault, but the airport and the captain was very humorous about the wait which made it better. I would fly with them again."
"✅ Verified Review |  
Do not order any online extras next to your ticket, or if you do – make printscreens of your online orders and print your ticket details/receipt. Although I saw in Skytrax reviews that this airline has serious issues with keeping up with extra services that people paid for, I decided to give them a try. I booked the tickets online from the Pegasus website and chose the most expensive package available called “Ekstra” with flexible change/cancellation rules, seat selection, 25kg baggage, and hot meal with drink. I made online check-in and dropped the baggage, and everything was smooth in the airport, except that the flight was delayed and took off 00.15 (instead of scheduled 23.15), which was the case with most of the flights in SAW airport that night. I had no issues with my pre-selected seat 2F, however when purchasing online it was advertised as wider seat with more leg space, while in fact the seat was of the same width like all other seats and the legroom was nothing extra – it is simply the first row on right-hand of the plane so no seats in front of you. I would not recommend paying extra for the seat. As soon as plane took off, I was served the pre-ordered hot meal (schnitzel). The cabin crew refused to serve me the free drink, although I had paid for it online. They claimed that drinks were not included in the package “Ekstra”, although when I bought the package online, a drink was listed as free and I even made a printscreen of package details and showed it to the attendant. We argued for at least 5 minutes about the drink (while my hot meal was getting cold). I provided them with my ticket details (sent by Pegasus to my email), but apparently that .pdf file only mentions that a hot meal is included (no explicit mention of a drink). When I claimed that “Ekstra” package includes drink and showed the printscreen, the attendant started arguing that since August 15 the Pegasus policy has changed and no free drinks are issued next to food anymore. Only when I insisted and after I had provided my ticket receipt (with purchase date on August 8), did the attendant conceded and give me a free drink. By the way, both Pegasus journal and inflight menu advertise that if I purchase schnitzel menu and a drink (which I did online), I should get free coffee/tea or water. Of course, that did not happen, and I did not want to fight again over coffee as I just did over cola. I have return flight waiting, and I guess I should be ready for a meal fight again."
"✅ Verified Review |  London Gatwick to Istanbul. Appalling service, no regard for customer service. Original flight was delayed taking off by 85 minutes due to delays in loading baggage, as a result missed take off slot. Given a cup of water. Had three children plus two adults. Information being given by pilot and flight crew was virtually non existent and despite flying out of London, with majority english speakers, was mainly in Turkish.  I know this is Turkeys equivalent of a budget airline, but Ryanair or Easyjet are a million times better.  As a result of the delay, missed my connection, then the alternative flight was also delayed by almost 2hours. No free food, meals, drinks etc. But when a fellow passenger wanted to purchase a drink it took over an hour! They forgot about the meals and drinks I purchased. There must be some repercussions for this level of incompetency and unprofessionalism."
"✅ Verified Review |  Istanbul to Amman via Ankara. They had no interest in helping the customer as in my case. I did a purchase for the same ticket two times by mistake, the reason is an email I got after purchasing the first ticket says the payment did not succeed wich I understood as an unsuccessfull purchase. So I did a mistake and purchased again but I found that the email is a routine reply they send after each purchase and I do not understand why. So I ended up with two tickets. I cancelled the first one and lost 80% of what I paid (850 Euros). A terrible experience, and I promise not to travel with this Company again."
"Erbil to Ankara. I have heard good things about Pegasus Airlines which is why I chose to go with them. One of the best things was that I could purchase additional luggage online. However, their website is absolutely terrible. I could not purchase anything ahead of time, despite the many many links listed to do so. I could not purchase my ticket through their website, but had to do via kayak.com. I may have heard good things, but the website alone is enough to make me never want to fly with them again."
"✅ Verified Review |  Cologne to Tehran via Istanbul. This is the first time my husband and I flew Pegasus Airlines and we think we will not fly them anymore ever again. The customer service was below average, the seats are tight and we are having problem with our inclusive meal in every sector of our flight. We have bought the Advantage package, which includes 30 kg luggage, seat selection and Sandwich + Beverage. None of the flight sector accepted our claiming of food because they said it was not shown in their list and we should have book it in advance online. But there was no function or page online that allows us to choose our sandwich. The crew does not even know what is included in the Package, seems like their knowledge our company's products is limited. I wrote an email to the customer service to solve this issue one week before our flight back to Cologne as there is no Pegasus office in Tehran. Unfortunately, they only reply my email today, which is 2 days after my return flight! The customer service just wrote a short 2 sentences email and told me that no food to be served on Tehran flight. But the whole case was not just Tehran, it was all the sectors! I have attached the booking page screen shot here, there was no where mentioning that we food was not included in Tehran flight which is what they are claiming, not even in our printed itinerary! The sandwich does not cost much of money and we are not petty about a sandwich, but the fact is we have paid for it and they should offer us the service that we have paid for! Below are the summaries of our flight experience with Pegasus: Cologne to Istanbul: Flight delayed due to the coup crisis in Istanbul (our bad luck!) but the ground staff handled the situation well. The crew on board were OK, the legroom is acceptable at this point. No food can be claimed according to crew as they don't have us in their list. Istanbul to Tehran: Crews were rude and unfriendly. Narrow legroom and seats are tight. No food can be claimed again. Tehran to Istanbul: Crews were OK. Narrow legroom and seats are tight. The representative from Tehran took our name and said she will settle the food problem for us, but when we were on board, no food can be claimed again. Istanbul to Cologne: Crews were OK. Narrow legroom and seats are tight. No food can be claimed again. There was a little girl sitting behind us and has been kicking our seat from the back for like 4 hours and she wouldn't stop even we complained to the mother and the stewardess even talked to the mother. The mother didn't care at all! This is the worst flight sector ever. We had the same problem with little kids behind us when we flew Turkish Airlines from Istanbul back to Frankfurt last year. I don't think this is the right was of operating an airline. Pegasus should consider changing their online system to be more user friendly and retrain their staff and crews about the products of the company."
"✅ Verified Review |  My flight from Bodrum to Manchester on 06/06/2016 was cancelled by Pegasus. I found out about this cancellation via my transfer company on 05/06/2016. Contacting the Airline I was told I could only fly back to the UK by using either Stansted or Gatwick. I was told by the call center staff that I would be compensated for my onward travel from Gatwick. On arrival at Bodrum airport for the 11am Gatwick flight it was a shambles, the 7am Gatwick flight had been cancelled and everyone was using the 11am flight. People had arrived at the Airport from around 3am in the morning to get the 7am flight. Several passengers were told there was no room on the plane and they would have to fly to Istanbul and make their own arrangements to get back to the UK. My only option on arrival at Gatwick was to get a train home costing me £108. I have tried contacting them via their website, no joy there. The UK helpline is a waste of time. Managed to get help from their PR company in the UK who did their best. At no stage has anyone said the word sorry."
"✅ Verified Review |  Check-in - there were lines but it went smoothly, woman at counter seemed newer but was helpful and got everything in order for us through to Zurich. Strict on 8kg for cabin baggage. Flight on-schedule from Bishkek to Istanbul and from Istanbul to Zurich, airplanes clean, service good, though minimal. Seats a bit small, ordered food served promptly - good portions, tasty and filling. All luggage made it in very good condition. Definitely 4-star out of 5."
"✅ Verified Review | Istanbul to Prague with Pegasus Airlines. Checked in online but it doesn't matter as there are no special lines for bag drop. The check-in lines were long. The boarding process is chaotic. There was no organization at all. The cabin crew was adequate. The plane was clean. The flight was punctual."
"London Gatwick to Istanbul. I arrived at Gatwick for my Pegasus Airlines Istanbul flight. I had flown in from Istanbul 10 days earlier with no problem. At Gatwick the flight did not show on the departure board and there was no Pegasus rep there either. I contacted them by telephone and was told that the flight was cancelled. They also said that they had told me (which they hadn't or I would not have been there). The only option they could suggest was that I get to Stansted for their flight from there later that day. I spent three hours on the bus in horrendous weather and eventually boarded their flight from there. We landed in Istanbul just as my connecting flight to Dubai (on another airline) was taking off. With my original plan I had five hours between flights. The main airport hotel was full (this was 2200hrs). I had to buy a new ticket with my onward airline for their next flight which was 30 hours later. What an utter shambles with no apologies at all from Pegasus. They also told me that my return flight had been cancelled before my original departure from Dubai so I fail to understand why I was not told when I checked in for the Istanbul-London flight. Definitely not recommended."
"✅ Verified Review |  London to Bodrum via Istanbul with Pegasus Airlines. There were 4 passengers on our booking plus we were travelling with friends making a total of 7 of us, 4 adults and 3 children. Due to the delay with the first leg, we missed our connection onto Bodrum and although this was an annoyance, it does happen but we do feel that the way in which the whole situation was handled was appalling. The communication between Pegasus and stranded passengers was terrible and left a lot to be desired. When we were delayed in Gatwick, 2 of us enquired separately about the transferring flight in Istanbul and both of us were told by the gate staff that the transferring flight would wait for us. This was obviously a lie. Also, as we thought we’d be arriving in Bodrum but delayed, I didn’t have time to cancel the private transfer we had booked from Bodrum and had to pay for this twice so 100 GBP total. On arrival at Istanbul, the chaotic scenes and confusion was very stressful for us especially as we were travelling with children who were tired, upset and hungry. The waiting around was unacceptable and the organisation of the situation by Pegasus was awful. On top of all this, on the flight to Bodrum the next day, our daughter was separated from us some 10 rows ahead even though we had paid for the privilege of choosing our own seats on the original booking. Then, the flight attendant wanted to charge us for the food that again we had already paid for in our bundle even after explaining to her the situation and showing her the booking confirmation. There were extra cost incurred due to the airlines fault and they refuse to compensate us. "
"Copenhagen to Tel Aviv via Istanbul. First of all it was delayed so we missed our connecting flight and had to wait 5 hours for the next in Istanbul. The pre-ordered pre-paid food did not come. We asked both in Copenhagen and Istanbul and were assured our food would be there. The staff on the flight did not care. They did not want to help. We proved we had paid food but they said we have to email Pegasus for a return of money and buy food onboard. We could not get food for the amount we already paid. The email was sent a week ago and still no reply. I will never fly with this company again and I advice everyone to choose another company. They are not serious. The airport they dump people is not the ordinary airport but a small place with only few toilets that are not even clean. If you want to have a good vacation, don't travel with Pegasus. I have traveled a lot but this was my worst experience without comparison."
"✅ Verified Review |  Tel Aviv to Dubai via Istanbul. I flew on three Pegasus flights within 7 days. All were awful. The worst thing is the ridiculous limited weight for both checked and carry-on baggage. Carry-on is limited to 8kg (my small suitcase empty is 6kg). I weighed, transferred things to checked baggage, and re-weighed several times to meet the restriction. Then when checking in, even though my carry-on bag only weighed 7.2kg (which was perfectly visible on the scale), the Pegasus agent kept insisting that my bag was 2kg overweight. When I asked how much the extra weight (which she couldn't understand was actually below 8kg), she shrugged her shoulders. It was complete incompetence. Finally her supervisor explained that the weight was fine. Fortunately, a fellow passenger told me that a passenger could carry on a second bag that wasn't even weighed! So, naturally, I put my heaviest items in my extra bag - only to return the heavy items to my carry-on bag right after it had been weighed. The whole thing felt like harassment and was totally absurd! I went through this hassle on each of the three flights. Finally, nothing on board is without cost. Not even a drink of water is provided. I'll never fly Pegasus again, and I don't recommend that anyone do so."
"Athens to Dubai via Istanbul with Pegasus Airlines. Worst flight experience. The cabin crew were the rudest I've ever experienced. There was a delay on the first flight from Athens of around 3 hours. When I had to return there was a delay of 8 hours and then the flight was cancelled. Eventually we flew again the next day in the afternoon. There was no manager or anybody from the company in Dubai. After almost 10 hours of being in the airport they took us to a hotel to sleep and there was chaos before and after this. Pegasus is a low fare company but I wouldn't recommend to anybody as they can be really unprofessional and ruin your trip."
"✅ Verified Review |  We booked the trip from Stockholm to Istanbul via Amsterdam with KLM, we checked the weight allowed, and hand baggage with one accessory may weigh max 12 kg. We start our trip from Stockholm without any problem but once we get to Amsterdam everything turn to nightmare, with this next flight to Istanbul operated by Pegasus, and person from Pegasus weighs hand baggage. He first stopped my wife and told her that she has 10 kg and need to pay 50 Euro to check in the hand baggage but when my daughter start to argue with him by explaining that we booked this trip with KLM and our departure was from Stockholm, this person was rude and forced us to check in my daughter baggage as well - in total we paid 100 Euro."
"✅ Verified Review |  In September 2015 I did a short Istanbul to Dalaman round trip. Granted my flight was short so I didn't feel too numb from the narrow seats, but it was a really cheap ticket and I did not experience any delays. Pegasus is very strict about how much you can bring and not, but my experience has been better than other low cost carrier (EasyJet, Ryanair) and I've yet to see rudeness from the crew. The attendants are swift in service (which makes sense because you will be paying some extra money). As I like to try airline food, I ordered their beef steak and for around 12USD, I thought it was a decent dinner. Basically, the service compared to major US carriers, the seat size being less in Pegasus, which isn't amazing on these other carriers either."
"✅ Verified Review |  Gatwick to Sharm el Sheikh via Istanbul Gokcen. In all my time flying I have never experienced such an appalling catalogue of events as I did with Pegasus Airlines. BA cancelled my flight to Sharm el Sheikh and I had to book Pegasus Airlines for a lot of money for a no frills product. At Baggage Drop Off at LGW, despite my having a boarding pass I was unable to be processed. After two hours I was finally entered onto the flight manifest by Pegasus. At that time I was also advised that my return flight would not land at LGW but at Stansted Airport. There was only availability for a flight returning to LGW five days earlier as I had parked my car at LGW and there were no flights available after my return date. So upon my return, after a night of very little sleep I had to take public transport form Stansted to Gatwick to collect my car and drive home. As Pegasus Airlines is a Turkish airline and not a European airline they treat customers with little respect. The telephone manner of the airline assistants is of a very poor standard indeed. I cannot recommend Pegasus Airlines at all and I will never fly with them ever again. By the way, I did not receive any advance email advise for the change of circumstances or an apology."
"Stansted to Hurghada via Istanbul with Pegasus. Avoid at all costs. Staff really rude. They kept us waiting 1 hour on the Tarmac at Istanbul without any announcement. No frills airline but easyjet or Ryannair are much better. The announcements in English were so fast you couldn't understand them at all! We paid extra for exit row seats but had a problem as a couple decided they were going to sit in our pre booked seats."
"The worst flight in my life. I was flying with Pegasus Airlines from Zurich to Athens via Istanbul. 50 minutes delayed departing in Zurich. As we approached Istanbul aircraft was flying for about one hour over Istanbul without landing. No announcement from the crew or from the pilot. Most passengers were in panic. After landing in Istanbul they informed us that the airplane to Athens had left. We were until 2am at the airport negotiating with Pegasus staff to give us tickets for the first flight the next day to Athens no matter what airline. They refused. We had to stay for one night in a hotel in the middle of nowhere and we were flown the next day noon to Athens with Pegasus. Staff was insufficient and rude. Never again."
"Oslo to Istanbul with Pegasus Airlines. I bought the advantage package that gives you a checked-in luggage, choice of meal and seat selection. I was not given the seat I chose at purchase and I was given a different meal to that ordered, at least I got the suitecase. The service onboard is good, but the level of English skills makes it difficult sometimes. A good selection of dishes onboard."
"Pegasus Airlines is the worst airline I've flown with! Our flight from Ercan to Frankfurt was cancelled and they only contacted one of my travel partners, but not even me. We tried to call them back, but they just said we should just book another flight. At the airport, we were told that we are not registered and it took ages and heaps of discussion and effort to finally get a scheduled flight. That flight was more than one hour on delay and the air in the plane was so hot and dry that we all ended up feeling sick. As water was not free of course, we had to pay 1,50Euro for just 330ml of Water! The worst flight experience I've ever had and I will never ever fly them again."
"London Gatwick to Bodrum via Istanbul. We never even got off the ground. Despite checking in online and printing off boarding passes, when we came to check in our bags the Pegasus Airlines check in agent said that we were not on the system for the flight. While we waited over an hour for the check in staff to ""try"" and sort out the problem we received a text from Pegasus (in Turkish). We obtained a translation and found that Pegasus had cancelled our return flight. We were given a number to call but that was a Turkish free phone number unobtainable from the UK. We asked the Pegasus check in agent for a telephone number in the UK and he told us that there was not one. We would have to sort the problem online. This turned out to be untrue as we later discovered that there is a customer services number in the UK. Anyway, by this time the outbound flight was closing and we abandoned our holiday as we were still unable to check in our luggage and our return flight had been cancelled. We are currently awaiting refunds but will never book with this airline again."
"Pegasus Airlines from Madrid to Dubai. I recommend using any other airline. We arrive at the airport in Madrid over 2 hours early, and the line to check bags was so long and slow and took over an hour. It took so long we almost missed our flight. Then we get to the gate and they stop us and make me check my carry on with no reasoning. Speaking in Spanish and pointing and then asking for my return flight information. The seats on the plane were so small my knees were touching the seat in front of me and I'm not even tall. Then we get to our final destination in Dubai and they lost my luggage. Then went to the lost baggage counter they said this happens with Pegasus all the time. "
"Geneva to Istanbul Sabiha Gokcen. Pegasus Airlines is somewhat worth it however, if you have better choice, don't go for it.  Very tight seats and there is barely any space to eat. Cabin Staff are helpful however, they do not seem to like what they are doing. Horrible main meal and overcooked. Snacks and salads were good. Inflight Entertainment there is nothing except the magazine. If you have choice of which airline to go, avoid Pegasus. However, if you do not have a choice you can go for Pegasus, it gets you from A to B."
"Been many years since I tried to fly Pegasus - I give them 1 star that they have opened up a direct link between CPH and AYT to avoid Istanbul airports - that's about it. Tried to book several times on their webpage - which now has 4 options available, which is a good idea if you were able to book it online. Went to an office and booked my tix - chose the flexible fare which includes seat, 25kg luggage and meal. Bought 5 extra kgs. Tried to use online check in as I need some more kgs, not possible. On check in I had 3 kg too much - fine I will pay. Went to the desk - they do not accept credit cards, they did not accept DKK and No Liras - only Euros. Yes only Euros. They wanted me to go exchange Turkish Lira into Euros - in Turkey! Refused to do so, and they gave in and let me pay in Lira, their own currency. Onboard they did not have a clue of what was going on and the prepaid meal was not served and they wanted me to pay again - finally they found out it was their mistake. As a punishment they did not clear my table so I put the tray in the gangway before landing - seats are unconmfortable, service non existing - crew busy having fun among themselves."
"Everything related to the flight with Pegasus was really bad. First, at Düsseldorf Airport, there was a 30 minute delay. Furthermore, at Istanbul-Sabiha airport there was another 30 minute delay on the flight heading to Beirut (both delays were in the airplane and due to boarding problems, the crew showed up too late). The staff on the first flight were very unprofessional and rude towards passengers. They barely spoe anything but Turkish the whole time. While booking, Pegasus sends you a confirmation email fully in Turkish with no way of reading it in English. Even the staff at the official Pegasus office where I booked were very rude and careless. Overall, it was a very bad experience. This is not my first flight, I have been flying for 18 years now on short, medium, and long-distance trips. I have flown with various airlines such as Lufthansa, Air Berlin, Middle East Airlines, Qatar Airways, Quantas, Air France, Emirates, Etihad, etc. and Pegasus was worse than all of them, by far worse."
"Barcelona to Istanbul with Pegasus Airlines and everything went smoothly. Cabin staff were nice, aircraft was modern, ground staff were ok (they could smile a bit more). Their website is easy to navigate, and add on extras if you wish. Plane left a tad late, but i didn't mind as I wasn't in much of a hurry. Captain communicated on how the flight is going. "
"Very nice flight to Dubai from Stansted via Istanbul with Pagasus Airlines. The staff at Istanbul were very helpful and were at arrivals waiting for me with a buggy to take me to the gate for the Dubai flight. The food onboard was tasty and was at an high standard however it is expensive so I purchased mine online in advanced. I had steak from London to Istanbul and grilled meatballs from Istanbul to Dubai. Seats where ok - they do recline but not that much. Drinks and alcoholic bevrages need to be purchased. Toilet facillities on both flights where clean and taps etc where working fully. Overall nice and comfortable overnight flight and cheap too."
"Dubai to Marseille via Istanbul and Pegasus Airlines is the worst airline I have taken. I booked and paid for a breakfast that I never had. The organization of the check in was so messy that it took hours, the staff was not nice, especially in Istanbul, and definitely not helpful. This is not an international airlines, barely a flying bus."
"We made the mistake to fly Berlin Schönefeld to Dalaman via Istanbul with Pegasus Airlines. The flight from Berlin to Istanbul was delayed, but the cabin staff assured us that we would get our connecting flight. They told us all flights are delayed, which was not true. We arrived four hours later at our destination, around 2:30 a.m. We have tried to get some compensation, but they just try to keep you busy. It is just a waste of time."
"Madrid to Tbilisi with Pegasus Airlines - before flying, I checked reviews and I started to fear my decision but my experience was good. Check-in online worked and at the counter in the airport - no problems. Cabin crew were young and nice. Aircraft was a new Boeing 737-800. Food onboard was a choice from 5 menus, salads, sandwiches and snacks and prices were normal. They give you 330cc cans of drink. Service on board was as good as any ""full-service"" airline. Luggage arrived safe and sound (stop-over included). I fly low-cost every time I can because the airlines must be good, efficient, cost-effective and the best choice to survive."
"Being an expat in Lebanon, I often come back to France and I sometimes used Pegasus as their rates are sometimes attractive. But the truth is that it’s not worth it considering the hazards you have to bear. Once, my connecting flight was cancelled in Istanbul, I suppose because it was not full enough, so all the passengers had to wait the next flight, 3 hours later. But no information at your arrival in Sabiha airport, you just see that your flight is not displayed on the board, and no way to find a Pegasus agent in the airport. So long hours staying in uncertainty. Of course, you want to complain after that. I did. But I just lost my time. They just send you automatic replies or repeat the same “we are sorry to inform you that, we cannot pay you any compensation”. Another bad experience among others, always in Sabiha airport, a nightmare. I had a 3 hours layover in an incredible mess, people sitting everywhere on the ground and flights leaving every 5 minutes. 1 hour before the time, I came to have a look at the board to see my boarding gate. No information. Weird. I came back 35 minutes before the time : gate closed! Incredible. At the most, the information was displayed 20 minutes. Then, I understood why so many people were just sitting at the foot of the board… In spite of the complete disorganization of the airport, I finally found someone of Pegasus and realized that we were dozens in the same case. At least 9 just for the flight to Paris. All with the same experience. We were taken our passports and boarding passes and were said to wait maximum 30 min. We actually waited almost 2 hours. I was then invited to go out of the airport, go to the Pegasus desk at the departure level, and ask a new ticket. There were still many places on the next flight to Paris, 2 more hours later, but the employee told me that I would have to pay the new ticket! She was very unfriendly ; when I told her that there was something going wrong in their organization, she just told me that I could go in front and buy a ticket with Turkish airlines if I was unhappy. She made me clearly understand that I had no choice. But what was my astonishment when I met again one of the other persons that were in the same situation. She told me that she explained her case and that she hasn’t had to pay any extra! I complained again on the Pegasus website. But they just make a fool of you, sending automatic or totally irrelevant replies. I decided not to fly Pegasus any more. I prefer choosing a company that respects its customers."
"Hassle free flight from Paris Orly to Istanbul Sabiha Gokcen. Check in process was quite easy and was pleased to be assigned exit row seat without extra payment. Boarding via bus was quite easy at Orly Airport. Flight was delayed leaving Orly due to weather conditions in Istanbul. Onboard experience was good. Catering is by DO&CO but is paid for and is of a very high quality, but expensive. Service and attitude of flight attendants was acceptable, although they don't smile very much. Inflight entertainment consisted of mainly Turkish advertisements that would have meant nothing to non-Turkish passengers. Overall it was a pretty good experience for the price paid."
"The Pegasus Airlines operators never respond and thanks to them, I'm unable to rebook my return flight. Sadly this is not the first time we are facing trouble with this airline. Last year, they lost our luggage twice and returned it towards the end of our holiday and haven't apologised, not once let alone compensated our losses. Now due to not being able to reach the operator I called the administration, where I was spoken to in the rudest possible way. Clearly I should have stopped flying with them since the time they lost our bags but you just think that must be an accident. Guess they will never learn to treat customers with respect they deserve. They are no longer new if that's their excuse and at this rate no matter how cheap their flights are they'll lose their clients because customer service is a foreign subject to them!"
"In October 2015 I booked Pegasus Airlines from Oslo to Antalya via Istanbul return trip for February / March 2016. On 24 December 2015 I received notice on e-mail that both flights Oslo - Istanbul and return were cancelled, so I replied and requested a refund. On 12th January Pegasus called me on my phone, gave me the option to cancel for a full refund or to book another flight. I chose to cancel, and was refunded in full a week after. Given the situation in Turkey the cancellation is understandable, and I was pleased that Pegasus called me instead of me having to call them. So I give Pegasus an 8 for their service in case of cancellation."
"I was absolutely appalled by the way I was treated by Pegasus Airlines. I flew from Geneva, where a lot of customers nearly missed their flights because Pegasus did not allocate enough check in desks for everybody to check in efficiently. It resulted in some people waiting for 3 hours to get their luggages checked in! Then, after a layover in Istanbul, I arrived in Dubai when all the luggages from Geneva have been lost. We were a lot of people at the Lost Luggage Desk at Dubai airport to complain about this, and Pegasus was completely useless and could not provide any support. During two days it was a constant battle to get any information from Pegasus on where our luggages were. We eventually found them after going directly to Dubai airport and realising that the luggages were sent on a flight the day after we arrived in Dubai. I flew with a lot of airlines with low levels of services, but this one is the worst."
"Pegasus Airlines service level is very low. The only reason we choose this is it is landing to Stansted which is near my house. There is not much price differences, you cannot choose your own seat on check in. I bought 5 kilo extra for £31 and when I had 1 kilo over for my luggage they charged me again.  Also they lost my partners luggage today from Istanbul and nobody knows where it is. No more Pegasus Airlines for us, even it is a free ticket."
"Stansted to Dubai via Istanbul. If you can endure endless flight delays without apology, very uncomfortable and cramped seats, rude staff, and transit baggage left in Istanbul because of flight delays then fly with Pegasus Airlines - you will never have a negative review about any other airline, because Pegasus Airlines is by far the worst I have travelled in my 50 years of flight."
"Moscow to London Gatwick via Istanbul. I have many things to say about Pegasus Airlines but its only negative. I am a frequent flyer and Pegasus is the worst of all. Flight delays - if you have a connecting flights make sure you have enough time. Bad customer service - no information regarding cancellations and delays, they don't care about you, they never reimburse you or say sorry for their awful services. Even if its a bit cheaper at the moment, it might cost you a lot more later on."
"Stansted to Dubai via Istanbul on Pegasus Airlines. Worst airline I have flown. Flight at Istanbul left without us 20 minutes after we landed. We weren't able to find the gate because it wasn't listed on the board. There was nobody around the airport to explain to us what was happening so we wondered aimlessly for 5 hours trying to find out what was going on. Staff were unbelievably rude and unhelpful. Had to wait two days to get on a new flight and we didn't even know if we were on it until we got to the check-in counter. When told half of the passengers doing the same flight were not put on the new flight, staff were exceptionally rude in sorting out a replacement ticket, avoiding eye contact, speaking to each other in Turkish and snapping at me for being annoyed. I can understand that there are some things such as snow that are out of an airlines control, but the way in which Pegasus dealt with this problem and the appalling attitude of their staff made the experience ten times worse. I am sure that I am not the only one that will be avoiding this airline at all costs from now on."
"Amsterdam to Tel Aviv via Istanbul. I am writing this review while I am waiting in line at the lost and found. My bad experience with Pegasus Airlines started long ago before even getting on the flight. I got an email that my flight was delayed and after checking myself, I found out that I won't have enough time to get to my connection flight in Istanbul, and I had to call and change 6 tickets manually  - which I think is suppose to be done with a phone call from the airline company and not me calling them. Of course there were more minor delays during the trip and best thing that can happen is that I have to waste 3 hours in the lost and found to get my baggage - after I specifically asked about this before my departure in Amsterdam and they said ""don't worry about it, the baggages will get there the same time you do."""
"Gatwick to Istanbul return on Pegasus Airlines. The service outbound was neutral, nothing good or bad to say. The plane was ex-AirAsia - as careful lifting of a sticker on the back of the seat revealed! On the return, which was 2 hours late due to extra security and 40 minutes to clean the plane of snow which had fallen overnight, the staff were pretty awful. They say you can pay in Euro for food and drink, but they told me they didn't have Euros to give me change and they would pay me back in pounds. I kept having to ask for them to give me my change, it took about four asks, and they returned me my money in a very surly manner. I decided to insist, due to their attempts to fob me off. Also the toilet had a problem and the back half of the plane smelt terrible for about an hour. I would fly them again on short routes, but I suggest if you don't want to pay for their overpriced food and drink by credit card (for which I imagine they get an inducement) to take your own food and drink."
"Copenhagen to Krasnodar via Istanbul. My flight with Pegasus Airlines was alright, but due to weather conditions they've been cancelling our flight to Krasnodar for three (or maybe more) consecutive days, even though both the Istanbul and Krasnodar airports are open, and Pegasus and other airlines have flights departing from Istanbul. In the airport, everything is chaos. I didn't consider myself lucky to be in a hotel and have my vacation shortened, but compared to living at the airport for three or more days I now know how lucky I am. When spoken to, Pegasus are not very helpful in explaining, why we are not flying, and if you call them up on the Turkish phone line and choose English language, there will be no answer. Everybody that I've met says: ""Never again will I fly with Pegasus Airlines"". Now I know."
"Istanbul to Kuwait with Pegasus Airlines. They checked our Handbags at check-in counter, provided us with tags and accepted handbags for the aircraft. They stopped myself and many other passengers, families, couple, businessmen, solo at the gate before boarding, re-checked our handbags and fined us for the shopping done from the duty free. We had receipts for the shopping done but they forced us to pay extra baggage cost and those who couldn't had to leave their valuables at the gate. This is a very sad and wrong practice, no notification was given at the check-in counter."
"I booked a flight from Berlin SXF to Sarajevo via Istanbul SAW, sadly due to the weather conditions in Sarajevo my plane from Istanbul could not depart. Pegasus Airlines had at that time no other available option for the next 3 days, so they put us up in a hotel. But the company managed to organize an unplanned flight so Belgrade and then a bus till Sarajevo. They did everything very efficiently. They found a great solution and so once more kudos to Pegasus."
"Stansted to Dalaman via Istanbul. Awful airline. delayed at Stansted, no-one bothered to say why, and how long. As a result miss connecting flight to Dalaman. Staff at Istanbul unhelpful, left us standing for ages no explanation. Both I and Mum at home ringing customer service about luggage, we were told luggage in istanbul, go to collect it (got shouted at by staff there, police involved told man to stop). Told luggage had been put on aircraft for next morning. No-one seemed to know what they were doing. After several hours taken to a hotel, small meal provided. There 4 hours, picked up taken back to Istanbul. It transpired luggage had gone on the flight we missed, which seems insecure. Was grateful to have luggage - looking at reviews about delays lost luggage etc. no response to claim under EU regs, nor to email to CEO. Never again, dreading return flight. Aircraft was dirty."
"At the check-in counter, the attendant told me what I wanted to take with me in the airplane was fine. Right before boarding the airplane at the gate, their staff checked the weight of my backpack and charged me again for the extra weight. They allow 8kg into the airplane and mine was off by 4kg or so. I did not have anything worthy of paying extra for, but since none of my friends were with me at the airport anymore, I couldn't give them back the extra weight. So I ended up paying more than what I would have paid another, much nicer airline. It felt like they have found me stranded and were robbing me. I have a feeling that they give a commission to their employees to charge passengers for small overweight pieces. She actually used her own cell phone to enter my credit card information! It seems that it is how they make up for the amount that they charge less compared to other airlines. My suggestion; pay a bit more upfront, book a nicer airline, you will be more comfortable, much nicer seats, staff, meals (if you book Turkish) and you would not be caught with surprises. The staff were not nice at all. One of the passengers had a backache and asked for a pillow for his back, and the attendant told him that if he had a backache he should have planned ahead and brought something with him into the airplane. It is fine if it is their policy, but she was not very nice about it and they were arguing for a few minutes over this."
"London Gatwick to Kuwait via Istanbul with Pegasus Airlines. A truly awful experience. Long delays on both flights, rude staff and they lost my baggage. After losing my baggage they offered compensation of $120 but then revoked the offer after a month without payment. I will never fly with them again. Avoid folks!"
"Morning Pegasus Airlines flight  from Tel Aviv to Istanbul. Check-in process at Ben Gurion airport smooth. Flight was operated by the airline's old but well maintained B737. After antake-off I ordered lunch as meal and drink service is not complimentary onboard. I opted for turkish kofte with fresh vegetable salad and lemonade. Duty-free on board shopping followed. Cabin crew friendly and helpful. The plane arrived to Istanbul 10 minutes later of its scheduled time.  When I made to SAW airport immediately found out that my baggage is missing. After 3 hours of waiting time airline representatives informed me that luggage was not loaded to aircraft which I flew. So I have to wait 2 more hours for the next flight in order to have it. As I have another flight to New York I gave up waiting and left all contact information in order to get it later. But it took them 18 days to deliver my luggage. Their baggage tracking system does not seem to work properly. When I call airline representative said your baggage is still missing though I was told that it will arrive with next TLV-SAW flight. After writing a few emails to lost and found department they managed to send it to me. Even not directly to my adress. I took it myself at the nearest airport. Overall, this is typical LLC with friendly cabin crew, low fares, rather unprofessional staff at Sabiha Gokcen airport. I would rather choose other airlines to avoid these kind of problems."
"I had to book flight with Pegasus last minute to fly to Hurghada (via Istanbul) on 13th November 2015. What can I say, the reviews were bad but I had no choice but to purchase these tickets as my original ones to Sharm El Sheikh were cancelled. This is by far the worst airline you can fly with, they always have delays. I had total days of about 4 hours from all my flights. While I was coming back from Egypt my flight was delayed by 2 hours and in the end all the passengers were asked to carry their own baggage into the loading belt before entering the plane. I mean did I pay for my flight to be doing this? Poor in every way, I do not recommend this airline. "
"I like flying Pegasus on short-haul routes as it is very cheap compared to Turkish Airlines. Since the flights are less than an hour long, I do not mind not being fed. The planes are high density, but fairly new and clean. Flight attendants don't bother you over simple things, but are there if you need them. I board last, so I choose whatever seat is empty. Their luggage allowance of 20 kilos is also welcome compared to many European airlines. They are expanding fast and it is hard to train their staff for international standards, so dealing with them requires some patience. When I asked a staff member about this, he said that they simply cannot cope with the increase of traffic. "
"18.00 hrs service from Paris Orly to Dalaman via Istanbul was delayed by 1hr 40min. Bad service just terrible not on time, no food provided, not even a lite snack provided. Had to pay for food. Staff taking forever with the food cart. I understand that if I wanted food (though it should be provided for free) I had to pay for food by the time the staff came with the food cart. Food I was after was sold out. I bought something a little bit more expensive than I can afford. When purchasing food I was missing a bread roll. If I'm paying 15 euros for food. I want everything that's provided as mentioned above on poster, not missing a bread roll. Unprofessional, terrible unorganized airline. Also everyone don't fly with this airline maybe cheap but pay more extra instead of Pegasus Airlines."
"I was expecting something awful but Pegasus Airlines turned out to be a very nice experience. I pre booked seat 4A for a few euros and it was a comfortable leather seat with plenty of leg room for me (5ft 11). I also pre booked a chicken dinner which was served shortly after take off and as far as airline food goes it was superb. The crew were polite and the flight departed on time and landed early. This was a scheduled flight and I think a lot of people fly package holidays so the tour operator decides seat pitch and catering. Tomorrow Istanbul to Budapest and I hope the review will be the same."
"One of my worst experiences. The cabin staff took 1hr 45 mins to serve from the middle of the plane working their way down towards the end. All we could hear was them complaining about a passenger from the middle of the plane.  When they eventually got close to our seats and I made them aware of my needs for a drink, the hostess said that a passenger was rude to her, I told we were aware of this as we could all hear her and pointed out that was not professional. Her reply was she works very hard. I told her all I wanted was a drink, but she was very rude and stopped serving. Another passenger handed me her bottle of water. Another passenger had asked her three times for fruit salad for her eighteen month old son, but she never ended up getting it. The plane was filthy when boarded."
"Prague to Antalya via Istanbul with Pegasus Airlines. For pre check-in you can only select the middle seats at the rear of the aircraft for free, all others are charged at quite a high price. So, if there is two of you, you can only chose to wait for airport check-in and risk not to get a seat next to each other. Lousy check-in, taking ages. Staff not trained how to take payment for extra luggage, took half an hour! Airline forgot that Turkish winter time had just started, which effected in 1 hour delay (wrong slot). Airline doesn't even offer a glass of water for free. Food and drinks against payment were served only shortly before landing. Dropped my fork, got a new one after 10 minutes. The ticket price wasn't that cheap - not justified to my opinion. I will avoid this carrier in the future."
"One hour before the departure from Bishkek to Delhi, the passangers where informed that the flight is still in Moscow because of technical problems and the new departure was set 25 hours later. Bad situation for everyone (probably Pegasus is used to it) but it can happen. What made me angry was that we where driven to a hotel out of the city, where nothing could be done and it took 5 hours until we got some water to drink. The Pegasus Airlines support was also very bad, during a call they just hung up the phone and beside an automatical email I never got a response to my message. The next day the flight was fine."
"Frankfurt to Istanbul with Pegasus Airlines. A very disorganized airline, ground staff  couldn't check visa requirements properly, flight delayed and this is the norm for them.You pay for everything extra as this is a low cost airline.Security is ignored, we landed in Istanbul and before reaching the gate people stood up and walked around and staff didn't say or do anything. Will only fly them again if they offer a very low price, but still will have my second thoughts."
"We had a Pegasus Airlines flight from Bucharest to Istanbul and then to London. They said that there will be 30 mins delay due to technical issues, and 1 hr later they cancelled the flight. They offered us 5 star hotel accomodation and only 10€ / person for food. What can you buy worth 10€ in a 5 star hotel? They rescheduled the flight next day at 7am, but they still had 2 hrs delay and we missed our connection flight from Istanbul to London because of the delay. Pegasus Airlines staff does not speak english at all. It is really hard to communicate with them. Our flight from Istanbul to London was delayed by 1 hr and 20 mins, however no one gave us any reasons why. No one offered us even a cup of water during the 4hrs flight. When we finally got to London at 00:10, one of our lagguage was missing."
"Pegasus Airlines really is a hit and miss airline. I use Pegasus regularly and they are very inconsistent in the service they offer. The fares are reasonable but not especially cheap when that is you add on all the extras and normal person might like to have. I always pre-book a specific seat usually an aisle seat at the front for which I have to pay for on every leg of the trip, eg from Ercan to Istanbul and then from Istanbul to Budapest so on a return flight you are paying around an extra 300TL on top of the price of your ticket, on several occasions recently I have been asked to move from my pre-paid seat. One occasion was so that three friends of one of the male cabin staff could sit at the front. I refused to move from 2C to 24B and you wouldn't believe the hassle I got for the rest of the flight. On another occasion I was asked to move so that a Cypriot disabled person could sit in my seat, an exit seat mind you, and therefore be close to the toilet. Again, I refused and pointed out that he had every opportunity to reserve a specific seat, further pointing out that someone who needed to use crutches and claiming to be severely disabled must not by law sit at an exit seat. He went into a wailing fit claiming to know the owner of the airline, cabin staff tut tutted at me throughout the flight but I stayed put! Interestingly, once we arrived at our destination, I was amazed to see aforementioned disabled person without crutches strutting across the airport tarmac, racing to get to the immigration control before anyone else, I had to check to see that we hadn't landed at Lourdes by mistake! Cabin staff appear to be poorly trained, not particularly customer orientated to the point of being downright unpleasant. The food on board is usually of very good quality and fairly reasonably priced, when they have it that is, On this particular flight we had just taken off from Istanbul, I was sitting in seat 2D right at the front and upon ordering my meal was curtly told 'No finished' so guess the pilot and cabin crew had scoffed the lot before take-off! I have one more pre-booked flight with Pegasus and that is it. I will be flying with Turkish Airlines or from Larnaca in future where there is a better choice of airlines. Pegasus used to be very good, what has happened in the last two years one can only guess. Changing aircraft at Sabiha Gökçen always turns into a nightmare of change gates, broken and painfully slow security checks by uninterested ground staff. Their website flypgs.com is known locally as fly pigs as that is how you are treated!"
"I did this return flight from Stansted to Ercan in North Cyprus via Istanbul in October. My return trip to London on 15th October was the most uncomfortable flight I have ever experienced! Seated in an aisle seat, 20C, before leaving Ercan another passenger inadvertently dropped a piece of luggage onto my head, which caused a headache for most of the journey plus made me feel panicky. The aisle itself was extremely narrow, which meant that body space severely invaded due to no fault of their own by cabin crew and passengers standing in and walking up the aisle. Leg space in this aisle seat was tiny and significantly less than the ""middle"" seat, 20B, next to me. The  prices of these flights are cheap, and I had a much more comfortable forward flight to Cyprus on 5th October, seated in a Window Seat - and I imagine the middle seats OK too. Hot food, meatball dinner,  which I purchased on forward flight was excellent. Flight attendants were good. My advice would be good value flights, provided you can avoid aisle seats."
"Don't fly with Pegasus! You think you are saving money but it will cost you more at the end. We made our reservation online and got our email confirmation with a confirmation no and everything was fine. When we got to the airport they told us that we don't have a reservation. I showed them the email, they said your reservation was cancelled. Without us knowing anything! They told us that we have to buy the tickets again. We were lucky that there were still empty seats. The surprise was that the ticket price was double that what we paid on the Internet and they wouldn't accept making us pay the same price. We paid the double price because we had not choice. We tried to communicate with their customer service afterwards but no answer. Save your money and fly with another company."
"Having read the reviews about this airline after I had booked my tickets I was a bit concerned. However, other than a two delay at Stansted the flight was on the flight out, everything else was fine. It was a bit difficult to understand what the pilot was saying, did that matter, no. The staff were very helpful and pleasant. The return journey from Ercan back to Stansted was on time. The plane landed at Ercan 15 minutes late but the crew turned the plane round quickley and we left on time. We did the normal touch down into Istanbul, refuelled and took off on time landing 20 minutes early into Stansted. The flight crew were again very helpful and courteous."
"Pegasus Airlines called less than 7 days before the flights date and said that our flight is not flying, and we have two option either to cancel the flight, or to schedule another one. But we have to depart from the airport in the next day, so we asked for accommodation and they said they will not give us accommodation. I requested to talk to the manager because they canceled the flight less than 7 days, so we have rights to have accommodation - they said he will call us, but he never did and they changed the flight without our permission and agreement! We had to cancel it ourself and to book an expensive one the next day !!!"
"Heard bad things prior to flying with Pegasus, but my experience flying from Beirut to Stansted via Sabiha Gokcen was great. Both flights on time, comfortable seating, pleasant crew, nice aircraft. Considering the price I paid for my ticket, I was very happy with the service I received. We arrived 35 mins ahead of schedule in London. Would fly again with Pegasus Airlines."
"An exellent Pegasus Airlines flight, flight attendants were friendly and attentive. We were pleasently welcomed onboard and wished a nice holiday at Dalaman. We asked for seats together and got them on both journies. The seating was comfortable with plenty leg room, lights were dimmed so we could sleep on the flight back home,  then woken about one hour from landing at Manchester and refreshments were then offerd before landing. "
"Pegasus Airlines flight from Cologne to Istanbul (connecting flight) is delayed by 45 minutes, Istanbul to Dubai is delayed again by 1hour. I have 2 check-in luggage which until now I haven't received and it's 7 days delayed already! The luggage is in Dubai airport 5 days ago but since I am living in Abu Dhabi and not in Dubai, I requested Pegasus to deliver to my house soon. I received a call from the delivery guy, he said that his airport pass is expired and can only have a new one after 3 days then he will deliver my luggages. But that never happened, so I kept chasing (email/sms/call) Pegasus Airlines to do something about this. Pegasus replied that they will investigate this matter but it's already 7 days delayed!. I will never forget this horrible experience. This is also my first time to take Pegasus Airlines and is my worst experience ever! "
"Beware of Pegasus Airlines: On 26.2.15 I purchased 2 flight tickets through Pegasus internet site. The confirmed e-Tickets were sent to my email address on the same day. Two days before departure, when trying to make advanced check in, I was surprised to see, at Pegasus site, that the tickets were cancelled without reason. My Visa account showed that Pegasus never charged me, but they did not issue any cancellation note. I bought tickets from another airline, which were, due to time pressure, more expensive. Pegasus customer service claimed that the tickets were cancelled by them as a result of a ""Suspicious Card"" message received from Visa. My Visa service confirmed, in a formal document, that they did not cancel the transaction. Pegasus told me that they have tried to notify me by phone (once) but I was not available. The customer service could not explain why a ticked issued and sent by email is cancelled by a phone conversation, that actually did not happen. By July 2015 I filed a complaint through Pegasus site,  but no actual response. I repeated the process by end August 2015. Again no answer and I am still waiting for them."
"Izmir to Cappadocia via Istanbul with Pegasus Airlines, and the worst service we have ever received from an airline. We have never come across an airline that cancels a flight with no notice. This is exactly what happened to us today - we flew from Izmir and needed to connect via Istanbul to Cappadocia. Firstly we were delayed 30 min due to traffic and then once landed we raced to catch our next flight, only to find out from my tour company that this has been cancelled. We tried in vain to get any conclusive feedback from staff, who spoke little to no English. And don't even bother to speak to the transit desk or information desk as they are rude and not helpful at all. Shame you Pegasus Airlines for this terrible service for us and many other tourists who had to wait in excess of 6 hours for the next flight."
"Pegasus Airlines has zero customer service. My flight was delayed two hours. Upon checking in my luggage, the agent never mentioned the delay. We went into the waiting area for the flight. Once the other flights left, we were asked to leave the waiting area. The security staff let us know of the delay. Upon going to the agent that handled our check in, we were told we should have checked the boards (the boards were not updated). She said she did not remember taking care of us just fifteen minutes before. No once did she apologize, was very rude and practically said it was our problem. Spoke to two other agents, who did not even give us a change to speak, just said it was not the agents fault. Once again, no apologies, stoic faces. Same treatment on the flight by flight attendants, no welcome aboard, no smile etc. Did not even offer a cup of water. Tried to sell drinks and food. Their customer service is horrible at the airport and onboard. I would urge not to use this airline as they're also known for chronic delays. Learned my lesson the hard way."
"Pegasus Airlines airport staff is just pure inept. I am sitting at Istanbul SAW airport right now waiting for my flight to Dalaman. They have been delaying the flight in small increments without any announcements. Currently the delay is 2.5 hours. In fact, a Pegasus Airlines flight which was supposed to leave after my flight to the same destination,  is already boarding. When you try to ask them if they can provide any information they just say ""no English"" and get an easy escape. I flew with them on another flight from Izmir to Istanbul a couple of days ago too. While on that occasion, the flight was on time, the cabin crew was quite rude at the time of seating. In short, this airline has left a bad taste for me, but I guess that's what you pay for when going for the cheap ticket. I still hope I will make it to Dalaman today!!"
"We flew with Pegasus Airlines from Manchester to Dalaman return. We booked the flights through Travel Republic as a package holiday and were due to fly with Onur Air but the flights were changed and we had to fly with Pegasus, whom I had never heard of before. I read the reviews of this airline and was a little concerned and the airline scored 2/10. I should not have worried. The flight going out to Dalaman was slightly late but nothing to give us any concern. The return flight left on time so we had no waiting about either on the plane or in the airport. The seats were more spacious than other aircraft I have been on. I am a tall person and always feel hemmed in if I don't choose extra leg room seats. On this occasion because we were on a package tour we hadn't been able to book extra leg room seats but the seats we were allocated anyway were roomy and very comfortable and I was pleased with them as I thought I would be squashed in! The cabin crew were very pleasant and efficient. There was plenty of choice in food and drinks and the refreshments were well stocked. The safety routine was given by video by child actors who were very amusing but it made you sit up and take notice as it was a very different way of getting the message across and I think the airline should be commended for it. The flight track was shown on the drop down screens and remained up through the whole flight which was interesting and actually relieved the boredom of flying somewhat. It's good when you can see what progress the plane is making! The Captain and crew were Turkish and it was hard to hear what the Captain was saying some times although he did speak in Turkish and English. All in all I have no qualms about flying with Pegasus Airlines again and both flights were comfortable and stress free."
"Kayseri to Zurich via Sabiha Gökçen. Check-in in Kayseri a bit chaotic. Transfer in Sabiha Gökçen (Istanbul) was okay . Both flights on time and smooth. Istanbul-Zurich I paid an extra premium for additional legroom (worth it) and ordered two special meals (gluten free and child meal) online. Meals were served according to the order. Flight attendants were not particularly friendly but the service onboard was acceptable. Across the board, a rather positive experience, but Pegasus Airlines value proposition definitively not comparable to Turkish Airlines."
"I was scheduled to fly from Cologne CGN to Baku GYD. My flight was due to leave at 14:30 but was delayed by about 4 hours. Causing me to miss my connecting flight from Istanbul SAW to Baku which was due to leave at 20:55. When I arrived at Istanbul (approximately at 22:20) I was told that the next flight to Baku would only be the next morning (cannot recall the exact time but it was around 11:00). I asked about accommodation for the night and straight away was given a very rude answer.  I was given a lame excuse that my flight from Istanbul to Baku is a code sharing flight operated by Azerbaijan Airlines it is not the responsibility of Pegasus Airlines to provide me with these things, even though i purchased my ticket from Pegasus Airlines website. I was told a that all hotel rooms are full in the whole city of Istanbul. After 2 hours of arguing with airline representatives (they seemed to bounce me around because I was persistent while most other passengers who were also delayed gave up). I was granted 1 free meal as well as 1 free drink. I had to spend the whole night (about 11 hours) at the airport and had to sleep on the airport floor. All airline reps I spoke to were rude, not only to me but to all the passengers stranded at Istanbul SAW airport that night. Upon my arrival I filed a complaint of their website where I explained the whole story, but their complaints page is not functional.  All I got in return was silence. Reading through some reviews left on this website, I realize that Pegasus Airlines does not care about its passengers and that these incidents are common for them. The rudeness of the staff was appalling. "
"Our Pegasus Airlines flight from Gatwick to Dalaman offered a bit more leg room than other flights, but the staff were exceptionally rude and unhelpful. Whilst serving beverages and snacks they stopped half way as they were running out of time and needed to do duty free. They then moaned when we asked for a coffee. Will not recommend Pegasus Airlines."
"I paid for 4 meals pre-flight for our Pegasus Airlines  flight. My details were apparently not passed on and so my children and partner and I did not have any food. The meals I had ordered for my children were not available. We then had to pay for chocolate croissants to fill them up. I have emailed pegasus twice about my refund, but have not had it responded to. Shame on them"
"Pegasus is the cheapest and also the worst airline you can fly from/to or in Turkey. There is never anyone to help you. They do not answer your complaints. I have flown over 10 times with them and there has not been a single time that the flight was not delayed. Especially if you are flying to SAW airport expect delays of at least 1 hour or more. The flights take 35-40 mins but the delays almost twice as much. I know other airlines are more expensive but who can buy your time back?"
"We were supposed to fly Pegasus Airlines from Izmir to Brussels Charleroi via Istanbul. Our first flight was to leave at 08h45 from Izmir - we arrived well in time at the airport. Right after checking in we got a message telling us there was a 1 hour delay. We went to the Pegasus Airlines counter to ask what to do since we had connecting flights - the woman said she couldn't help us. After some not so nice words from both sides she manages somehow to convince another person from Pegasus Airlines to liste"" to us. The woman didn't even listen to us and had a ready prepared answer to us she even repeated several times...and even asked us why we didn't book an earlier flight to Istanbul. She told us the flight to Charleroi was also delayed so no worries. There would even be someone from Pegasus Airlines waiting for us to make sure we would pass the security via fastlane. In the end the flight from Izmir to Istanbul was delayed more then 3 hours and the only thing we got was warm water (one little bottle) and Pegasus Airlines staff trying to hide so they didn't have to help the passengers. Arriving in Istanbul our flight to Charleroi already left and there was no help from Pegasus Airlines. We went to the Pegasus Airlines counter only to find lots of people screaming and shouting. We finally managed to talk to someone that ""couldn't help us"" but we could change our flight to the next day. Since we are both working that wasn't an option. When I asked if there was no other solutions she proposed a refund of our flight ticket home? We finally asked her if we could not change the flight to another destination close to Belgium - so she asked ""us"" what other airport there was.  After about 45min we finally managed to rebook to the evening flight to Amsterdam (by car 2 hours from home). We would have to get the tickets from check-in and be able to even get our luggage on the right plane since there was enough time. Check-in went ok and the person said she would call the luggage guys to make sure it would all go smooth.  When boarding time arrived still no gate was showing, so we went to the first Pegasus Airlines person we saw - he announced us another delay from 2hrs for our flight to Amsterdam - meaning we would leave Istanbul around 21h00. By that time not much energy was left to even say anything. After boarding we hoped for some rest on the plane, but no, the staff drove back and forth with the drinks cart, taxfree etc - so we had no sleep at all. Staff was less then friendly, didn't even bother to offer water, and if we asked we had to pay. After arriving in Amsterdam we had to find out that Pegasus Airlines  didn't even bother to transfer the luggage to the plane - it arrived today at Charleroi. Of course everyone at Pegasus Airlines promised us that we could always file a complaint, by calling them (cost of 50c/min - so they can even get more money from us."
"London to Sharm el Sheik return, via Istanbul in each direction. Our Pegasus Airlines flights were delayed both ways for more than 2 hours. Arriving to Gatwick, our luggage was missing. We will never use Pegasus Airlines again."
"Probably one of the worst experiences I have had with an airline, with extremely poor customer service, flights delayed, cancelled. Was on flight from Kayseri to Istanbul and meant to proceed to Izmir. Plane delayed 1 hour at Kayseri, they then let us on the plane, but another 3 hour delay before take off. The cabin crew then refused to give water to the customers unless they paid for this. Cabin crew quite aggressive towards the customers. On arrival several hours late in Istanbul, at midnight, the ground staff were unhelpful and aggressive, got to hotel at 2.30am and another flight the next day. Baggage arrive at Izmir and damaged. Have written to the company and no response to several emails."
"I know this is a budget airline but budget should not mean bad customer service. I flew Gatwick to Istanbul and in the same week had a return flight back from Istanbul to Stansted. On both occasions my flight was delayed over 2 hours with no update as to why. Forget an update there wasn't even a person to speak too! Finally after making it on to the plane (again speaking for both flights) the staff are so rude. I asked if they had a blanket as I was poorly on my return trip and simply got a no! "
"What a cattle market. Awfully cramped with terrible food and drinks. Service was poor. Announcements in English were to be guessed at as you could not understand the garbled messages. "
"Value for money. Seats are more comfortable than other low budget airlines that I have used. Gets you from A-B comfortably. Staff are friendly and attentive. Do not expect luxury, this is a low budget airline and meets the standards expected. I would recommend this if you are flying for 4-6 hours."
"Delays on all 4 flight. Check in was good in London but terrible in Antalya and Istanbul. Staff not very competent. 4 hours flight, with delays and not even a glass of water offered. Food and drink very very expensive on board. Announcements not in English until we complained. Not a good service. Invest a little more and get the comfort and respect you deserve as a paying customer. "
"Because of the very long queue in front of the 12 international Check-in counters of Pegasus Airlines we missed our Flight out from Istanbul to Zürich, Switzerland. 9 out of 12 counters at the check-in were opened and the personal does hardly neither speak nor understand English. 20 minutes before take-off of our flight we were allowed to bypass the queue and do the check-in, but it was too late already, because we also have to pass the passport control, which was another long queue. Running to the gate and arriving at 11:09 the ladies from Pegasus Airlines looked scared and irritated when we arrived. The flight was scheduled for take off at 11:10, but we could not get on. Back to the passport control not allowed to ""re-enter"" the country and no offices or counters from any Airlines in that area, we had to wait till an employee of some airline passed by. After another hour the paperwork for invalidating our exit stamps was done. in the meantime there were several groups of passengers missed their flights (from Turkish Airline). Next we had to go to the ticket counter and buy our tickets for the flight back. The earliest was next day, meaning we also had to stay overnight in a hotel. One Pegasus employee was very competent and helped us to get some information. Next we had to pick up our luggage, which was in the area of the international arrivals - you can only get in when the doors open. No luck with the luggage, even we were picked up by an employee from Pegasus Airlines and we waited at the lost and found counter. My fiance and me went back to get the tickets, because we were told that our tickets are reissued for the same flight next day. While in another long queue at the tickets counter, people were fighting and yelling at Pegasus Airlines employees. After several attempts we were able to get the tickets, but the hotel we had to pay out of our own pockets. At 1800 we went back to the Airport Arrival and after long discussions we could go to the lost and found counter from Pegasus Airline and the luggage from my fiance was there - mine made it onto the airplane and was already in Zurich. Next morning we arrive 3 hours before our flight at the airport at the international Check-in counters and this time it was even worse, the queue was much much longer. But because of our experience from the previous day and only 2 hours because of the first flight to Istanbul SAW we actually made it back. Flying cheap can become expensive. If I fly again with a cheap airline then I will only have a small luggage, so no need to check in. Disorganized and overwhelmed staff in the queue area of the international Check in counter, not all counters were opened, Pegasus Airlines staff neither understanding nor speaking English. "
"If you expect warm friendly service this is not the airline for you. I mean not even a smile in the 2 flights I took. I saw a boarding passenger asking a flight attendant to point out where he was seating and she just gave him a dirty look. Overall the flights were ok, 30 min delay on both flight which seems to be the norm. I guess they manage to get you from A to B without any kind of style. Nothing compared to TK."
"I had four flights booked on Pegasus for business and vacation. and the four of these flights were delayed - not few minutes, at least an hour or hour and a half. Pegasus Airlines made me miss business meeting, lose a car rental booking, miss catching up with friends and made the whole trip stressfull. I spent more than 15 hours waiting in airports or airplanes. They don't communicate right, they say 30 min delay and you end up waiting 90 minutes."
"Incompetence is the main theme here. Plenty of wasted time with employees just staring at your documents with no clue of what should be done. A family of 5 got divided across the cabin with a 6 year old allocated a seat by himself. The cabin crew blamed the ground crew and asked the father to manage with the rest of the passengers because they were busy taking orders for the meals. Once you shift into the cabin, red eyed flight crew were aggressive and had zero tolerance towards even children closing their window shutters. We understand we paid less for our seats but we never expected such rude treatment."
"The staff were not very welcoming, ignoring the passengers boarding and no goodbye as you left the plane (even when you made an effort to say thank you to them). There was no inflight film or radio during the flight, I had two children with me, flying to Turkey (4 hours), and had to try and keep them occupied the entire flight. I was not the only one in this predicament that day, there were lots of families with young children flying."
"Quite a nightmare trying to get from Tel Aviv to London via Istanbul with Pegasus. Our initial flight was delayed by almost 3 hours, with staff at the gate nonchalantly doing goodness-knows-what on their phones, responding to questions without the slightest hint of regret that the plane hasn't arrived, and the screen not updated with new information, with passengers strewn on the floor napping or waiting impatiently. When my boyfriend and I got onto the plane, we had to wait for more than an hour before it started moving. One muffled announcement in incomprehensible English early on about bad air traffic in Istanbul and that was it, no further updates for the rest of the wait. Zero flight attendants walking in the aisle (some sitting in passenger seats not doing anything), no courtesy of offering the basic need of water during the wait. (Of course you had to buy it off the menu later on in the flight, they won't even give you basic drinking tap water for free). When passengers went up to the Head Attendant during the wait to find out what's going on, he made sure to shut the curtain and hide behind it after every conversation, like an ostrich with its head in the sand. As the flight took off, we asked a stewardess about the estimated time of arrival. She held up a finger to indicate 'wait', brisk-walked off, and we never saw her again. Of course when we finally got to Istanbul we'd missed our flight. What was initially a comfortable 2.5 hour layover turned into a 30 minute miss. We were told by someone at the transfer desk that we will be put in a hotel for the night and put on the same flight in 24 hours. After getting out of passport control, leaving my boyfriend no choice but to purchase a visa for Turkey, we went to the Pegasus desk where staff were being bombarded with questions, and I felt a little sympathy for them. After explaining what happened, a woman helped us to get on a flight for the next morning, an earlier flight than we were told, which was good. Staff yelled names of people and gave instructions in Turkish but not English, but eventually we followed a woman to a coach which took us (after another long wait) to a very nice hotel, where we were served sandwiches that night and had a buffet breakfast in the morning. The following morning the coach to the airport was 20 minutes late, and the queues for check-in in the airport were unbelievable, Pegasus counters looked like a marketplace compared to quiet Turkish airlines ones nearby. My boyfriend and I thought we were going to miss the flight AGAIN, but after queueing for about an hour, we did make it to board the flight, which was 20 minutes late. I am going to try to avoid Pegasus at all costs within my means. The hotel and its staff were a great redeeming factor, the staff who helped us at the airport in Istanbul got the job done, but everything else was awful."
"Terrible! 3 hours delay before they let us get on the plane. When we asked for food or water the staff said they don't have any, but then they said we can buy some that we can see in the brochure. When we asked for it they said they're not letting anyone buy food or drinks. "
"Ercan to London Stansted via Istanbul Sabiha Gokcen.  Pegasus ground staff at Ercan were helpful. My return flight was a morning flight, we were greeted politely by the cabin crew, they assisted me to put my hand luggage in the overhead bins.  The flights were comfortable and both take offs from Ercan and Sabiha Gokcen and landings in Sabiha Gokcen and in Stansted went smoothly that my toddler slept through them. The safety video was quite cute with the superheroes. The negative thing I can think of is that some of the cabin crew are a bit difficult to understand. I had to ask my husband who speaks fluent Turkish to translate some of the things they said when they spoke the announcement in Turkish after the English. Apart from that there is really nothing else to fault with the airline. I see a lot of reviews complaining about leg room, plane size, if you want high service then spend more money on an airline who can cater for all your needs. "
"My journey began from London Stansted to Kayseri via Istanbul (SAW). Everything was going as planned until my flight departed 1.5 hours late. I was slightly concerned about this as I had another flight to catch from Istanbul to Kayseri later on that night. Having landed at Istanbul (SAW) one hour before my next flight I was worried about making it to my other flight, bearing in mind the gate closes earlier than the actual departure time. By the time I got off the plane and made my way toward passport check 20 mins had passed. I arrived at passport control to find a very long queue. I waited approximately 45 mins. By the time I had made my way into domestic departures, I checked the monitors to see that my flight was listed as ""Gate Closed"". I made my way to the Pegasus help / sales desk and explained my situation, the gentleman at the desk told me there was nothing that he could do and that my plane had landed 55 mins before my next scheduled flight, which apparently was more than enough time to make it to my other connecting flight. I purchased another ticket for 3 days later. I was guided towards the lost baggage area to pick up my baggage, which I had been told wouldn't have been put onto the plane as I did not show up to my flight. I was then given the news that my baggage had actually been put onto the flight to Kayseri."
"We have just landed after a Pegasus flight from Istanbul to Dubai. On the way there the flight was delayed and nobody cares to tell you anything. The seats on the plane are terrible. On the way back from IST to DXB the flight was supposed to leave at 20:30. We got to the airport and time has changed to 21:00. Then on the screen appeared EDT 21:50 but nobody confirmed. Finally at 22:00 we are boarding. . At 23:00 we take off landing in Dubai at 4:15am. We have just left the airport at 5:30. No entertainment, careless crew. Being a low cost carrier does not mean that you don't care about the service that you are offering. Passengers are still paying money and to me the service offered it is not acceptable. Never again on Pegasus."
"Recently flew to Munich from Tel-Aviv and back. It was a short flight but pleasant and enjoyable. The staff on board were polite and helpful. Although it was a short flight it was better then most regular airlines I have flown with. I will certainly fly with Pegasus again."
"No magazine, no film, very hectic staff. I have 3 children between 6 and 11. We got on the plane at 17.50 and got off the plane at 23.45. There was no food left to feed my children. We called the cabin crew twice and asked them if we could order food for the little ones, they kept saying that the trolley would get to us. By the time the trolley did get to us it was 21.20 and they told us that all hot food and sandwiches had run out. When I suggested that the elderly and children should be made priority I was given a look that told me that they really couldn't care less. "
"Currently sat on the tarmac at Gatwick an hour and 15 mins after departure time, having boarded on time and pushed back an hour ago. Delay apparently due to air traffic issues however most other flights seem to only have slight delays, not impressed so far."
"Flight was delayed in Madrid and again in Istanbul. Flight was hot and stuffy. Seats were small and leg space very narrow. Prices of food items are ridiculous. Paid 2€ for a 180ml milo drink and 2.50€ for a small packet peanuts."
"The flight was delayed for 10 hours in London, nobody to ask for information. Passengers were left without any information whatsoever. Arriving to Istanbul again same scenario, nobody to assist from Pegasus. After a long wait finally ground crew showed up and called up Pegasus to book hotels for transit passengers. Final flight to Dubai was 35 minutes delayed again and my pre-ordered meal was not available with very unprofessional cabin crew. Rubbish system and I will never fly with this airline again."
"This airline is not reliable at all. They cancelled my original flight 8 hours before departure. I resheduled my flight and the new one was delayed for an hour. They sell tea/water/coffee for extremely expensive prices, they charge customers to use the call center. Terrible customer service, narrow seats, the worst airline that I have traveled with."
"Flew twice in a day with this airline. Both times they had a 2 hour delay. No refreshments or anything during the flight, but a lot of commercials (instead of flight information). I will never fly with this airline again."
"Good flight - paid more to select seats ensuring we got the seats we wanted. I got my bags checked in fine all the way to the end destination despite being on a 15 hour transit. Check in crew were not picky over slight overweight of check in bags when they saw that we didn't use full hand carry weight (just a small bag each weighing less than 1kg) so that was good as I didn't want to lug a heavy bag around during transit. Would fly with them again."
"First and last time I'll fly with this airline, cabin crew very unfriendly and unenthusiastic. On a flight of 4hrs20 mins the crew served refreshments twice, however on the second occasion only actually served half the passengers - unfortunately I was one they didn't serve! I asked if I could please have a drink and was given quite a stern no. I could understand if they had been busy with food - however they were not, they spent most of their time behind their curtain at the back of the plane."
"First time I have flown with them and probably the last. I travelled with my wife and toddler. We thought it would be best if we boarded the plane empty handed so put our hand luggage with our check in bags. At the counter, we were 25kg under our allowance but they did not allow hand luggage weight to be added to check in bags so we were 0.6kg over our limit.  They already had a counter set up next to our check in desk and insisted we pay £11 or remove something. I had to open up the bag and pull another pair of trousers and a tshirt on! This was on front of all others waiting to check in. In the aeroplane, the seats lacked leg room, very uncomfortable. The cabin crew were miserable. "
"We flew from Istanbul (Sabiha Gokcen airport) to Dalaman (and from Izmir to Sobeha Gokcen for the return). Our experience was generally positive. On time. Pleasant staff. One issue: the bag weight limit is only 8 kg so virtually all roller boards must be checked. We paid extra to get a confirmed seat and early boarding, but in one
case entry to the plane was via shuttle bus, so the early-on extra cost was of questionable value."
"We flew from Newcastle to Dalaman on 25 May and returned on 1 June. I was a bit anxious after reading the reviews. The first surprise was the newish plane the seats were very comfortable which felt like soft leather (not material) with plenty legroom. The crew were very pleasant and friendly and seemed to go out of their way to be helpful to a couple of passengers who wanted to swop seats. The return flight was the same and both flights were spot on time. I would definitely fly with Pegasus again."
"Arrived at Stansted airport to be told that the UK flight to Istanbul was delayed by three quarters of an hour so I would miss my connecting flight. The next available flight to my destination was in two days. In the meantime I would need to pay for my visa entry to Turkey and would be left stranded at an airport hotel 25 miles from the city centre. All staff at Pegasus in Turkey were very rude. I received no apology and was told that if I didn't want such problems I shouldn't 'fly budget'. Needless to say when I got my replacement flight none of the food nor the extra legroom I had booked were transferred to the 5 hour replacement flight."
"We flew from London Stanstead via Istanbul eventually heading to Dubai with an 1 hr 40 mins stop over in Istanbul. The flight from London was delayed for 1.5 hrs sitting in a hot plane with no information given no updates - nothing. Food wise there is a menu provided but apparently nothing on the menu is available on both flights I took (London to Istanbul and Istanbul to Dubai) - what's the point of that exactly?. Eventually we landed in Istanbul over 2 hours late hungry and thirsty with no time to buy any thing to eat at the airport we had to run from one end of the airport to another so we wouldn't miss our flight."
"Had a return flight with them last April from Istanbul-Kayseri and despite being the only experience with Pegasus I can consider it the best LCC that I have had the opportunity to fly. New aircraft very friendly crew (in contrast with overall rude airport staff in Turkey) great prices and adding baggage/meal and allocated seat with a upgrade it is very good value for a small fee in comparison with other LCC. I recommend Pegasus."
"Have yet to have a flight without issue whether it be delays with boarding procedures constant delays due to late arrivals or equipment failure. They claim to be an International Carrier however 3 time in the last 2 months there has been issues with flights transiting SAW Istanbul airport and they have been unable to provide an English speaking staff member to consult with passengers. Pegasus Staff at SAW are rude. Compared to other low cost carriers I regularly fly unless you absolutely have to use them my advise is catch a bus ride a bike or walk before flying Pegasus Airlines."
"Flew with Pegasus as part of a package holiday to Bodrum I was a little apprehensive as I am not the best flyer and had never heard of the airline. Plane was new and modern on both trips and the staff were great language a bit of a barrier but there English was better than my Turkish. I would recommend this airline to anyone as I have flown with the package airlines i.e. Thomson First Choice Thomas Cook and this little airline blew them out of the water the seat space as standard far excels them."
"My trip from Antalya to Amsterdam via Istanbul with Pegasus was very bad and disappointing. The expected transfer time of one hour in Istanbul was one hour. Arrival at Istanbul was one hour late because of a one hour delay at Antalya. The connecting flight was already closed at arrival. On arrival in Istanbul staff informed me I should not expect to travel to Amsterdam that evening and would be booked on a flight the next day. Hours of arranging papers at the airport to arrange for a stay in a hotel in Istanbul and waiting for nothing. Very unprofessional personnel at the airport. Trip next day was a bad experience again long queues all over improper gate changes. Very bad experience indeed."
"Before departure was a nightmare. Not sure Pegasus has all the responsibility. Flight Izmir - Ankara. Plane was at the gate. At schedule boarding time boarding announcement in terminal. But nothing happened. The Pegasus Gate Staff stayed 5 minutes and left. He just came back 10 minutes after schedule departure time. During this time we had all boarding and final boarding announcement in terminal screen even showed ""flight closed"". When he came back we simply been told the flight couldn't depart due to technical problems we had to wait for another aircraft coming from Istanbul. we even received a message from Pegasus saying flight would now depart at 20.40 2h late. Again at 20.10 new schedule boarding time we again had announcement for boarding. But we still had no plane. The airplane only landed at 20.45 and finally departed 2.30 late. No clear information given during this time as said staff disappeared letting us alone at the gate without any information. However when we could finally board and go cabin staff were nice professional smiling and service was great. But ground service is a nightmare."
"We flew on a number of internal flights with Pegasus during our trip to Turkey as well as an international flights from Istanbul to Athens - which included a connecting flight- and had no complaints. We chose our seats and ordered a snack beforehand there were no glitches at all and we found the staff to be helpful and friendly. This airline exceeded our expectations for a low cost carrier."
"ATH-SAW-TZX on B737-800 ATH-SAW seat pitch was ok not great but on domestic flight SAW-TZX the seat pitch was very tight. Friendly staff but the cabin was uptight. We had ticket which included baggage and sandwich / soft drink. Sandwiches ware very tasteful. No IFE but you could see the trip on fall down screens."
